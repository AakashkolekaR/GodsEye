The action continues tomorrow as well. Do join us back. Until then, goodbye from us here.Meg Lanning, Australian captain: It\\'s a massive win for us. We were tested all the way. Really pleasing to get the win. We thought it was a par total. We felt if we could control the powerplay, we were in the game and I thought our bowlers did a fanstastic job. Taking the pace off the ball and trying to limit the boundaries, it was crucial to get the wickets at that stage. Healy has been dominating at the top with the bat and Haynes also chipped in towards the end.Amy Satterthwaite, New Zealand captain: Obviously disappointed with the loss. In all three facets of the game, we were outplayed. It was brilliant to see her (Suzie Bates) in form and she has been consistent for us over the years. But we needed someone to score runs at the other end. We didn\\'t execute our plans, there are glimpses of hope with the bat, just need them to step up at the right time.The Southern Stars book their spot in the Semi-Finals. Their 11th straight win in T20Is, on the contrary, 7th loss in a row for the White Ferns. On paper, it was a clash between the No. 1 and No. 2 ranked teams in the world but in the end, it was evident that there was a vast difference between the quality of these two teams. New Zealand were rattled early in their pursuit of 154, losing three wickets for 13. Bates and Martin launched a counter-attack with a 66-run partnership for the fourth wicket, keeping New Zealand in the hunt. But with Australian bowlers keeping things in check, pressure was mounting on the duo to up the ante. In search of big shots, both batswomen perished. New Zealand lost wickets in clusters from thereon and never really recovered. Presentations coming up.Alyssa Healy, Player of the Match: Just really pumped. The Kiwis were always going to come hard, they needed the win. Worked really hard on my batting, opened a new area of the ground that I can access if need be. Kiwis bowled really well in that middle period but 150 was always going to be tough to get. Might be a round of golf coming. Been a tough six weeks away from home. Looking forward to the game against India.17.3Sophie Molineux to Amelia Kerr, out Caught by Haynes!! Oh, what a catch. Sums up Australia\\'s fielding today, barring that blip from Kimmince, they have been outstanding in the field today. Molineux floated it well wide of off after seeing Kerr move across to the off-side. Went for the cut and hits it uppishly to the left of point where Haynes takes a sharp low catch. Australia win by 33 runs. Amelia Kerr c Haynes b Sophie Molineux 3(4)Sophie Molineux to Amelia Kerr, THAT\\'S OUT!! Caught!!17.2Sophie Molineux to Tahuhu, 1 run, wristed away to long-on17.1Sophie Molineux to Amelia Kerr, 1 run, Kerr shimmies out and tucks it behind squareSophie Molineux [3.0-0-18-1] is back into the attack16.6Schutt to Tahuhu, no run, full on off, Tahuhu blocks itLea Tahuhu, right handed bat, comes to the crease16.5Schutt to Hannah Rowe, out Bowled!! Gone! Southern Stars inching closer to victory. Leg-cutter that griped and straightened off the deck, Rowe advances and exposes all the stumps, ends up missing the cross-batted hoick. Hears the death rattle. Hannah Rowe b Schutt 4(8)Schutt to Hannah Rowe, THAT\\'S OUT!! Bowled!!16.4Schutt to Amelia Kerr, 1 run, helped towards backward square leg and it falls safe. Seemed like a top-edge as Kerr wanted to ramp it over the fielder at 4516.3Schutt to Hannah Rowe, 1 run, oh dear, Kimmince drops a dolly at mid-off. Flat-batted on the rise, Kimmince probably didn\\'t pick it and misjudged it. Grasses it onto the turf16.2Schutt to Amelia Kerr, 1 run, pitched up outside off, Kerr checks her defence to extra coverAmelia Kerr, right handed bat, comes to the crease16.1Schutt to Kasperek, out Caught by Haynes!! Last rites underway here. Schutt comes back and strikes in her new spell. Back of a length outside off, Kasperek charges out and scythes it straight to point. Haynes didn\\'t have to move an inch. Kasperek c Haynes b Schutt 12(7) [4s-2]Schutt to Kasperek, THAT\\'S OUT!! Caught!!Megan Schutt [2.0-0-9-1] is back into the attack15.6Delissa Kimmince to Kasperek, 1 run, direct-hit at the striker\\'s end and Kasperek was gone. Went for the cut and gets an outside edge to short third man. Was looking for a single and strolled half-way down the track before being sent back by Rowe. Kasperek turns and rushes in, but the throw misses the target. They eventually steal the run, courtesy overthrows15.5Delissa Kimmince to Hannah Rowe, 1 run, whipped off the pads to deep mid-wicket15.4Delissa Kimmince to Hannah Rowe, no run, leg-cutter, Rowe shuffles across and wears it on the pad15.3Delissa Kimmince to Kasperek, 1 run, sinks low and drags the slog-sweep to deep square leg15.2Delissa Kimmince to Hannah Rowe, 1 run, fuller length delivery outside off, driven to mid-off15.1Delissa Kimmince to Hannah Rowe, no run, cutter outside off, Rowe chases and can\\'t connect14.6Gardner to Kasperek, FOUR, oh, what a shot. Kasperek can bat, she certainly can. Engineers room by backing away to leg and opens up the off-side field by carving it over cover14.6Gardner to Kasperek, 3 wides, looped down leg, Kasperek misses the sweep and the ball clicks Healy\\'s pad before rolling away towards fine leg14.5Gardner to Kasperek, FOUR, edged and four. New Zealand want more of these. Fuller outside off, Kasperek throws her bat and a thick outside runs past short third man14.4Gardner to Hannah Rowe, 1 run, flicked away to long-on14.3Gardner to Hannah Rowe, no run, oh, almost had another one. Quicker and just outside off, Rowe pokes and missesHannah Rowe, right handed bat, comes to the crease14.2Gardner to Bates, out Lbw!! This should be the game. Bates departs and New Zealand\\'s hopes diminishes. Flat and skiddier, Bates came running down the track and ends up playing all over it. Gets rapped low on the pad, Healy went up straightaway, Gardner wasn\\'t too keen. But umpire Shaun George took his time before raising the finger. Good call as HawkEye shows that it was clipping the middle and leg stump. Bates lbw b Gardner 48(42) [4s-4 6s-1]Gardner to Bates, THAT\\'S OUT!! Lbw!!14.1Gardner to Kasperek, 1 run, bends low and brooms it away behind squareAshleigh Gardner [1.0-0-4-0] is back into the attack56 runs in 36 balls. White Ferns\\' will be banking on Bates\\' special here.13.6Delissa Kimmince to Kasperek, 1 run, dipping at the stumps, Kasperek clips it away to deep mid-wicket. \"Bowler, bowler\" was the shout and the throw came to the right end. The batswomen didn\\'t want to risk the second thereLeigh Kasperek, right handed bat, comes to the crease13.5Delissa Kimmince to Bezuidenhout, out Caught by Alyssa Healy!! Two wickets in a span of four balls and New Zealand are stuttering here. Short and rising outside off, Bezuidenhout was waiting to guide it to third man. Feathers a nick and Healy nestles in her glove. Australia on top. Bezuidenhout c Alyssa Healy b Delissa Kimmince 1(2)Delissa Kimmince to Bezuidenhout, THAT\\'S OUT!! Caught!!13.4Delissa Kimmince to Bates, 1 run, spectacular stop by Lanning at extra cover. Punched neatly from the crease and Australian captain dives across to stop it13.3Delissa Kimmince to Bezuidenhout, 1 run, veering on leg, tickled away to deep backward square leg13.2Delissa Kimmince to Bates, 1 run, swatted after lowering her stance to deep mid-wicketBernadine Bezuidenhout, right handed bat, comes to the crease13.1Delissa Kimmince to Maddy Green, out Caught by Perry!! Safe as houses is Perry. New Zealand lose half their side now. It was drifted on leg, Green was early into the pick-up shot. Gets a leading edge which balloons up to deep mid-wicket. Perry takes care of the rest. Maddy Green c Perry b Delissa Kimmince 8(7) [4s-1]Delissa Kimmince to Maddy Green, THAT\\'S OUT!! Caught!!13.1Delissa Kimmince to Maddy Green, wide, splayed down leg, Green tries to help it on its way but failsDelissa Kimmince [2.0-0-15-0] is back into the attack12.6Sophie Molineux to Maddy Green, 1 run, flighted delivery on middle, drilled away to long-on12.5Sophie Molineux to Maddy Green, no run, hurled quicker, Green gropes and misses12.4Sophie Molineux to Bates, 1 run, dances out, realises that she isn\\'t quite near the pitch. Adjusts and extends her defence to extra cover12.3Sophie Molineux to Maddy Green, 1 run, floated up, shaved away to long-on12.2Sophie Molineux to Bates, 1 run, straight-batted drive to long-on12.1Sophie Molineux to Maddy Green, 1 run, played down the pitch, awkward bounce for Molineux as the ball hits her wrists and ricochets away to the off-sideSophie Molineux [2.0-0-13-1] is back into the attack11.6Georgia Wareham to Bates, FOUR, another expensive over. Tossed up above the eyeline, Bates gets underneath it to smoke it over the bowler\\'s head11.5Georgia Wareham to Maddy Green, 1 run, pushed towards cover11.4Georgia Wareham to Maddy Green, FOUR, wow! What a way to get off the mark. Camps back and muscles it in the gap at deep mid-wicketMaddy Green, right handed bat, comes to the crease11.3Georgia Wareham to Katey Martin, out Stumped!! Wonderfully done. Wareham takes her revenge after getting hit for a boundary of the first ball. Well-flighted and lured Martin forward before dipping it late. Martin is yorked and lost her balance, dragging her back leg out of the crease. Healy calmly dislodges the bails quickly. Katey Martin st Alyssa Healy b Georgia Wareham 24(20) [4s-3]Georgia Wareham to Katey Martin, THAT\\'S OUT!! Stumped!!Has Healy pulled off a smart stumping here? She looks very convinced but the square leg umpire has sent the matter upstairs. Fair delivery. Oh, yes. Martin is gone.11.2Georgia Wareham to Katey Martin, no run, quicker and came in with the arm, Martin waits and taps it to point11.1Georgia Wareham to Katey Martin, FOUR, half-tracker and Martin takes toll. Was extremely quick to rock back and nails the pull, in the gap between deep square leg and deep mid-wicketGeorgia Wareham [1.0-0-8-0] is back into the attack10.6Delissa Kimmince to Katey Martin, 1 run, another loopy slower ball that dies at the stumps, Martin slog-sweeps it along the ground to deep mid-wicket. Bates was looking for the second but a loud \"No\" from Martin10.5Delissa Kimmince to Bates, 1 run, jumps low in her crease and cross-bats the slog to long-on10.4Delissa Kimmince to Katey Martin, 1 run, jabbed towards cover10.3Delissa Kimmince to Bates, 1 run, dipping slower ball, Bates is duped but manages to hoick it across the line to deep mid-wicket10.2Delissa Kimmince to Bates, no run, slower delivery, stays very low and makes life difficult for Bates.. couldn\\'t get her bat down in her quest to steer it to third man10.1Delissa Kimmince to Bates, FOUR, Bates has started to up the ante. Gets really low, waits for the ball to arrive and clubs it powerfully to the cow corner fenceDelissa Kimmince [1.0-0-7-0] is back into the attack9.6Perry to Bates, 1 run, length ball on off, pushes it into the off-side9.5Perry to Bates, 2 runs, advances down and carves it over extra cover, won\\'t have the legs to reach the boundary9.4Perry to Bates, FOUR, tipped over by the keeper. Should\\'ve been taken. Short of length, trumps Bates who had charged down looking to swing. Results in a top-edge that flies over the keeper. She got both hands on it9.3Perry to Katey Martin, 1 run, short of length outside off, dabs it to the left of short third man who has to put in the dive9.2Perry to Katey Martin, FOUR, full on off, little shimmy from Martin before swiping this over midwicket. Really good recovery from New Zealand with this partnership9.1Perry to Katey Martin, FOUR, short and wide, Martin smacks the cut hard through pointEllyse Perry [2.0-0-8-1] is back into the attack8.6Gardner to Bates, no run, fired full outside off, Bates mistimes the drive to cover8.5Gardner to Katey Martin, 1 run, darted through from back of a length, Martin tucks it through midwicket8.4Gardner to Bates, 1 run, swept to deep square leg8.3Gardner to Katey Martin, 1 run, turning in at the stumps, pivots on the back leg and works it behind square8.2Gardner to Bates, 1 run, almost yorks herself after dancing down, manages to jam it into the on-side8.1Gardner to Bates, no run, driven back down the pitch, hits the non-striker\\'s batAshleigh Gardner, right-arm off break, comes into the attack7.6Delissa Kimmince to Bates, 1 run, pushed to point, risky single, but the keeper broke the stumps before the throw arrived7.5Delissa Kimmince to Bates, 2 runs, magnificent in the field from Mooney. What desperation to stop the boundary. Bates\\'s slog-sweep looked set to beat her at long-on, but she threw herself across to cut it off7.4Delissa Kimmince to Katey Martin, 1 run, back of a length outside off, dabs it through point7.3Delissa Kimmince to Katey Martin, 2 runs, makes room and crashes it off the stumps through extra cover. Tidy work in the deep7.2Delissa Kimmince to Bates, 1 run, flat on middle, eases it to long-on7.1Delissa Kimmince to Bates, no run, driven to short coverDelissa Kimmince, right-arm medium, comes into the attack6.6Georgia Wareham to Bates, leg byes, 1 run, going down leg, Bates sits deep after getting inside the line, wants to help it fine but is unable to do so. Brushes off her thigh and ricochets off the keeper\\'s gloves to short third man. Casual running from Bates, didn\\'t expect a throw at her end and a direct-hit would\\'ve got her6.5Georgia Wareham to Bates, 2 runs, short ball turning away outside off, Bates slaps it wide of sweeper cover6.4Georgia Wareham to Katey Martin, 1 run, flighted leg-break, swept to deep backward square6.3Georgia Wareham to Bates, 1 run, eases it down to long-on6.2Georgia Wareham to Bates, no run, Wareham pushes this flatter, skids through onto Bates\\'s pad as she\\'s beaten thoroughly on the pull6.1Georgia Wareham to Katey Martin, 1 run, flighted up at the stumps, driven to long-on6.1Georgia Wareham to Katey Martin, 3 wides, not a great start from Wareham, slipping well down the leg-side and beating her keeper tooGeorgia Wareham, right-arm medium, comes into the attack5.6Sophie Molineux to Katey Martin, 1 run, darted in with the arm, nudges it wide of midwicket5.5Sophie Molineux to Bates, 1 run, sliding in with the arm, chipped towards midwicket, falls slightly short5.4Sophie Molineux to Bates, no run, flat at the stumps, punched back5.3Sophie Molineux to Bates, no run, fired wide of off, spotting Bates\\'s charge. Bates stretches across to smother it5.2Sophie Molineux to Bates, no run, pushed into the off-side5.1Sophie Molineux to Bates, SIX, Bates has got enough on this to clear long-off. Stepped out effectively and then unleashed the armsSophie Molineux [1.0-0-5-1] is back into the attack4.6Schutt to Bates, 1 run, couple of steps down from Bates, tucks this wide of midwicket4.5Schutt to Katey Martin, 1 run, back of a length outside off, patted in front of point4.4Schutt to Bates, 1 run, softly dabbed wide of short third man4.3Schutt to Bates, no run, came walking down with the intention of paddling it fine, couldn\\'t make contact.

It wobbles in front of the keeper to induce a fumble3.3Perry to Katey Martin, no run3.2Perry to Bates, 1 run, hops down the pitch, works it through midwicket3.1Perry to Bates, FOUR, length ball outside off, spanked off the front foot through point2.6Sophie Molineux to Katey Martin, no run, defended backKatey Martin, right handed bat, comes to the crease2.5Sophie Molineux to Satterthwaite, out Lbw!! Misses the reverse-paddle, struck in front of off. The pressure is getting to New Zealand Women, clouding their judgements. But Satterthwaite is unlucky here, as ball-tracking places the impact outside off. No review left. Satterthwaite lbw b Sophie Molineux 2(7)Sophie Molineux to Satterthwaite, THAT\\'S OUT!! Lbw!!2.4Sophie Molineux to Bates, 1 run, skids through from back of a length, Bates chops it through the covers2.3Sophie Molineux to Satterthwaite, 1 run, doesn\\'t quite get to the pitch after stepping out, drags a quick single to mid-on2.2Sophie Molineux to Satterthwaite, no run, length ball on off, played back down the pitch2.1Sophie Molineux to Satterthwaite, no run, pushed to cover-point2.1Sophie Molineux to Satterthwaite, 3 wides, down the leg-side, not a clean gather by the keeper which will add to the widesSophie Molineux, left-arm orthodox, comes into the attack1.6Perry to Satterthwaite, 1 run, squared up by a delivery leaving her with the angle, squirts it off a thick edge down to third man1.5Perry to Satterthwaite, no run, flat-footed in the crease, pats it into the off-side1.4Perry to Satterthwaite, no run, back of a length just outside off, chopped towards pointAmy Satterthwaite, left handed bat, comes to the crease1.3Perry to Devine, out Bowled!! Rams into middle stump after nipping through the gate. It\\'s a cracking start with the ball for Australia. This is a length delivery on off stump, Perry gets the ball to dart in of the seam which floors Devine whose footwork wasn\\'t the greatest. Devine b Perry 0(4)Perry to Devine, THAT\\'S OUT!! Bowled!!1.2Perry to Devine, no run, blunted into the off-side1.1Perry to Bates, 1 run, back of a length outside off, chops it down to third manEllyse Perry, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack0.6Schutt to Devine, no run, full ball on off, pushed to mid-off0.5Schutt to Devine, no run, back of a length outside off, stays low on Devine who tucks it to short midwicketSophie Devine, right handed bat, comes to the crease0.4Schutt to Anna Peterson, out Lbw!! Not a great shot this early in the innings. Short of length, Peterson looks to swipe it away cross-batted but it dips underneath and hits her on the thigh. She was quite low while playing the shot, so despite getting hit above the pad, the height won\\'t save her as she would\\'ve hoped while going for the review. This is crashing into middle and leg. New Zealand lose their review in the first over itself. Anna Peterson lbw b Schutt 0(2)Schutt to Anna Peterson, THAT\\'S OUT!!

Bates is on strike. Schutt will open the attackWelcome back. Can New Zealand carry the momentum which they gained towards the end of their bowling effort?First 10 overs: 82 runs, 1 wicket. Last 10 overs: 71 runs, 6 wickets. Extraordinary comeback from the White Ferns in the second half. Alyssa Healy made most of her purple patch, recording a hat-trick of fifties. Mooney gave her good company and Australia were off to a good start. But once Healy fell, they lost their way as New Zealand bowlers chipped in with regular intervals, which put the breaks on the scoring rate. Rachael Haynes gave the required boost in the end to lift Australia over the 150-run mark. Leigh Kasperek was the pick of the bowlers for the White Ferns with three wickets. With the dew setting in, it\\'s advantage Kiwis going into the break. Stay tuned, we will be back shortly.19.6Devine to Sophie Molineux, out Caught by Amelia Kerr!! straight to point. So, a wicket off the final ball of the innings. Shortish outside off, Molineux went across and dinked it airly, fails to pick the gap and hits it to Kerr at backward point.

Cutter outside off, Haynes gets under it and smacks it in the air towards deep mid-wicket. Bates bends low and shells it19.2Devine to Haynes, 2 runs, steered using Devine\\'s pace square on the off-side.

Haynes spanks it straight back at the bowler after coming down the track. Kasperek sits down and went with both hands. But it brushed the fingertips and zoomed away to long-off18.4Kasperek to Sophie Molineux, 1 run, Molineux ventures out and extends her arms into a drive to extra cover18.3Kasperek to Haynes, 1 run, quicker outside off, punched to coverSophie Molineux, left handed bat, comes to the crease18.2Kasperek to Perry, out Caught by Amelia Kerr!! Kerr resurrects her karm charts after dropping a sitter earlier. Third wicket for Kasperek, who has bowled beautifully today. Enticed Perry by tossing it up, Perry wanted to slog it across and lost her shape a bit. Fat top-edge is found and Kerr clasps onto it at point.

Caught!!18.1Kasperek to Haynes, 1 run, flighted delivery outside off, driven to long-offLeigh Kasperek [3.0-0-21-2] is back into the attack17.6Tahuhu to Perry, no run, off-pace delivery, Perry waits deep to glide it to point17.5Tahuhu to Perry, 2 runs, pitched up outside off, Perry slices the drive to point, misfield will allow them to pinch the second run17.4Tahuhu to Haynes, 1 run, goes searching for a cut, hits it to point and steals a quick single17.3Tahuhu to Haynes, no run, fuller on leg, wristed to mid-wicket17.2Tahuhu to Haynes, FOUR, poor, poor delivery from Tahuhu. Bowls a length delivery well outside off. Haynes chases and gets an outside edge which runs away to the third man fence. The fielder was inside the ring, so it was easy-peasy..17.1Tahuhu to Haynes, FOUR, pulled away witheringly in the gap. Short at the torso, Haynes took it on the front foot and controlled the pull all along the ground, bisecting two fielders in the deep on the leg-sideLea Tahuhu [3.0-0-14-0] is back into the attack16.6Amelia Kerr to Perry, no run, tossed up outside off, Perry makes room after charging down the track and drives it to extra cover16.5Amelia Kerr to Haynes, 1 run, skips out and heaves it off the inner half to deep mid-wicket16.4Amelia Kerr to Perry, 1 run, Perry uses her feet aiming to go over extra cover, the ball spins in and takes the inner half to trickle towards mid-wicket16.3Amelia Kerr to Perry, no run, throat-clearing appeal for LBW, not given. White Ferns challenge the decision. Fair delivery. It was the googly from Kerr, Perry came forward to defend without reading the wrong \\'un. Only question is if it is hitting the stumps? Nope, missing leg. Good call from the on-field umpire there16.2Amelia Kerr to Haynes, 1 run, rushes out and hoicks it through the line towards long-on16.1Amelia Kerr to Haynes, FOUR, nice shot from Haynes. Flighted on middle, Haynes scooches low and sweeps it in the gap between deep square leg and deep mid-wicketAmelia Kerr [3.0-0-18-0] is back into the attackEllyse Perry, right handed bat, comes to the crease15.6Anna Peterson to Villani, out Lbw!! White Ferns are chipping away at the wickets. Tossed up outside off, spins in and raps Villani on the pad, who was preempting the sweep. Missed the line of the delivery and paid the price. Villani lbw b Anna Peterson 14(11) [4s-2]Anna Peterson to Villani, THAT\\'S OUT!! Lbw!!Villani is given out LBW, she consults with her partner and reviews. Over to third umpire. No issues with the front foot. No bat there, confirms UltraEdge. Pitching - outside off. Impact - umpire\\'s call. Wickets - hitting. Says HawkEye. OUT.15.6Anna Peterson to Villani, wide, slipping down leg, wided15.5Anna Peterson to Villani, no run, saw the batswoman come down the track, Peterson pulled her length back and cramped Villani for room. Inside-edges it to square leg15.4Anna Peterson to Haynes, 1 run, Haynes chips out and ends up getting an outside edge which dips in front of short third man. Wayward throw to the keeper\\'s end and they will take the single15.3Anna Peterson to Villani, 1 run, swept away behind square15.2Anna Peterson to Villani, FOUR, and again.. spotted the flighted delivery early, jumps down the track and lofts it elegantly over mid-off15.1Anna Peterson to Villani, FOUR, just over mid-off\\'s head. Villani creates her own room and hammers it beautifullyAnna Peterson, right-arm off break, comes into the attack14.6Kasperek to Haynes, no run, appeal for LBW, but only the keeper is excited. Slower and Haynes sits down to sweep. The ball rears up and pings the flap of the pad14.5Kasperek to Haynes, no run, chipped back uppishly, just short of the bowler14.4Kasperek to Haynes, 2 runs, Haynes takes a cue from her partner and directs it very fine with a paddle14.3Kasperek to Villani, 1 run, swept away it fine legRachael Haynes, left handed bat, comes to the crease14.2Kasperek to Gardner, out Caught by Bates!! My word, Bates almost shelled a sitter but shows tremendous presence of mind to hold onto it in the end. Gardner gambols out seeking for a biggie and hits it towards long-on. No power whatsoever behind the shot and straight to Bates, who went reverse-cupped. The ball bursts through her hands to hit her face, pops up in the air and Bates tries to take it on the rebound. Falls back, loses her balance and cushions it on her chest. After juggling twice, she manages to cling onto it in the third attempt. They went upstairs to check if it was clean catch as well. Gardner c Bates b Kasperek 10(13) [4s-1]Kasperek to Gardner, THAT\\'S OUT!! Caught!!14.1Kasperek to Gardner, no run, flighted delivery, defendedLeigh Kasperek [2.0-0-18-1] is back into the attack13.6Bates to Gardner, 1 run, stabbed to mid-off for a quick single13.5Bates to Villani, 1 run, flapped down to long-on, a bit of yes-no situation. In the end, they decide against taking the second13.4Bates to Gardner, 1 run, cutter outside off, slapped to extra cover. Good stop from the White Ferns\\' skipper13.4Bates to Gardner, wide, served closer to the tramlines, Bates is penalised13.3Bates to Villani, 1 run, tucked away through square leg13.2Bates to Gardner, 1 run, swings south but the ball goes in the north direction. Courtesy a thick outside edge; pitched up outside off, Gardner wanted to lift it down the ground, plays it a tad early and outside edge flies over point13.1Bates to Villani, 1 run, aims for the toe-crusher, Villani flicks it through square leg with a closed bat face13.1Bates to Villani, wide, lousy start for Bates. Veering down the leg-sideSuzie Bates, right-arm medium, comes into the attack12.6Hannah Rowe to Villani, 1 run, clipped off the pads to deep square leg12.5Hannah Rowe to Villani, no run, short of length on middle, Villani shows her straight batElyse Villani, right handed bat, comes to the crease12.4Hannah Rowe to Alyssa Healy, out Bowled!! Cleaned up. Healy perishes. Went a long way across her sticks and Rowe just attacked the stumps. Healy couldn\\'t get any bat and misses it. The ball strikes timber and Healy combusts after a well-made fifty. Alyssa Healy b Hannah Rowe 53(38) [4s-8]Hannah Rowe to Alyssa Healy, THAT\\'S OUT!! Bowled!!12.3Hannah Rowe to Gardner, 1 run, full-faced bat knock to long-on12.2Hannah Rowe to Gardner, no run, cracked off the meat, straight to extra cover12.2Hannah Rowe to Gardner, wide, and again. This was slung it miles down leg12.2Hannah Rowe to Gardner, wide, drifting down leg, Rowe has to reload12.1Hannah Rowe to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, in order to manufacture room to go inside-out over extra cover, Healy uses her bottom-hand to drill it down to long-on unable to find the placementHannah Rowe [1.0-0-16-0] is back into the attack11.6Amelia Kerr to Gardner, no run, slowish leg-break, outside off. Gardner waits back to quell it11.5Amelia Kerr to Gardner, no run, similar delivery, albeit no bounce on this googly. Gardner is clueless and gets slammed low on the pad11.4Amelia Kerr to Gardner, no run, sharp googly, Gardner doesn\\'t pick it and the ball spins in to rap the thigh pad11.3Amelia Kerr to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, \"Catch\" was the shout but it dies in front of long-on fielder. Healy after skipping out, miscued the loft. Gets it off the toe-end, hence no power behind it11.2Amelia Kerr to Gardner, 1 run, jumps back and across to punch it away to sweeper cover11.1Amelia Kerr to Gardner, FOUR, freebie and Gardner accepts it with glee. Loopu full toss at the stumps, Gardner takes it on the full to smole it through mid-wicket. Desperate effort from long-on fielder in vainAmelia Kerr [2.0-0-12-0] is back into the attack10.6Devine to Alyssa Healy, no run, Healy was slightly moving to leg which prevented her from reaching out to this fuller length delivery that was stalking the widelines outside off10.5Devine to Gardner, 1 run, full and straight, driven down the ground to long-on10.5Devine to Gardner, wide, tries a similar sort of trickery but Gardner doesn\\'t shuffle in her crease. Lets it passAshleigh Gardner, right handed bat, comes to the crease10.4Devine to Lanning, out Caught by Katey Martin!! Big wicket for the White Ferns. Devine outfoxes Lanning. Wafted full and wide of off after seeing Lanning move across her sticks. Australian skipper went with hard hands and feeds an outside edge that is easily pouched by Martin. Lanning c Katey Martin b Devine 5(6) [4s-1]Devine to Lanning, THAT\\'S OUT!! Caught!!10.3Devine to Lanning, no run, shortish outside off, Lanning goes deep and flays it to backward point10.3Devine to Lanning, 3 wides, swinging down the leg-side, awkward bounce for the keeper and it scraps the webbing before wandering away towards fine leg10.2Devine to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, full and wide of off, Healy squeezes it to extra cover10.1Devine to Lanning, 1 run, soft-handed dab to backward pointSophie Devine [2.0-0-21-0] is back into the attack9.6Tahuhu to Lanning, leg byes, 1 run, slanted in on leg, deflects off Lanning\\'s pad behind square9.5Tahuhu to Lanning, no run, back of a length outside off, went for a repeat of that previous shot but failed to connect this time9.4Tahuhu to Lanning, FOUR, oh, what timing! Merely a steer from Lanning, has raced away past backward point9.3Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, short of length outside off, Healy takes account of this slower ball and carefully dabs it wide of cover for a single which will bring up her fifty. Power-packed performance this9.2Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, no run, checks the shot to cover9.1Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, no run, short of length outside off, wanted to dab it to third man but was beaten on the edgeLea Tahuhu [2.0-0-9-0] is back into the attack8.6Kasperek to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, tossed up on middle, mistimes the sweep behind square8.5Kasperek to Alyssa Healy, FOUR, that wicket doesn\\'t seem to have much effect on Healy, who cames bustling down looking for an inside-out hit. She wasn\\'t quite to the pitch, resulting in an outside edge flying past the keeper8.4Kasperek to Alyssa Healy, no run, dabs it to backward pointMeg Lanning, right handed bat, comes to the crease8.3Kasperek to Beth Mooney, out Caught by Bates!! Looked like a deliberate chip shot from Mooney, pretty sure her idea was to get it over extra cover, but she ended up hitting a lot straighter. Bates, at long-off, runs forward and settles for a safe catch. Beth Mooney c Bates b Kasperek 26(24) [4s-4]Kasperek to Beth Mooney, THAT\\'S OUT!! Caught!!8.2Kasperek to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, another aggressive shot from Healy, although she got this off the toe-end. Long-off cuts it off8.1Kasperek to Beth Mooney, 1 run, length ball sliding in on off, punched to long-offLeigh Kasperek [1.0-0-11-0] is back into the attack7.6Hannah Rowe to Alyssa Healy, FOUR, Healy is teeing off now. She has decided it\\'s time to go. Charges at the medium pacer and tonks it over mid-off. Danger times for New Zealand7.5Hannah Rowe to Alyssa Healy, 2 runs, full at the pads, flicked in between two fielders on the on-side, one of whom cuts it off. Two more though7.4Hannah Rowe to Alyssa Healy, FOUR, short of length, sits up for Healy and she duly whacks it through midwicket. Such is her power and timing, it storms past deep midwicket\\'s dive7.3Hannah Rowe to Alyssa Healy, FOUR, clears the front leg and clatters this over extra cover. This is brutal from Healy7.2Hannah Rowe to Beth Mooney, 1 run, full ball slanted in on middle and leg, whipped out to deep midwicket7.1Hannah Rowe to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, floaty full ball on off, pushes it through the coversHannah Rowe, right-arm medium, comes into the attack6.6Amelia Kerr to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, bit short with the googly, Healy rocks back and pulls to deep midwicket6.5Amelia Kerr to Beth Mooney, 1 run, loopy full toss, flicked down to long-on6.4Amelia Kerr to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, short outside off, slapped to sweeper cover6.3Amelia Kerr to Beth Mooney, 1 run, overpitched, smeared to long-off6.2Amelia Kerr to Beth Mooney, FOUR, mid-on is inside the ring, and this juicy full toss from Kerr is at the mercy of Mooney. She dances down and smokes it to the long-on boundary6.1Amelia Kerr to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, flat googly towards off, stabbed wide of coverAmelia Kerr [1.0-0-3-0] is back into the attack5.6Kasperek to Beth Mooney, FOUR, she\\'s got a nice piece of this.

Poor start to Kasperek\\'s spell, drifting it down leg, and Healy is severe with her swipe through backward squareLeigh Kasperek, right-arm off break, comes into the attack4.6Devine to Beth Mooney, FOUR, flicked over the infield by Mooney, who hasn\\'t looked at ease out there, but this should settle her down4.5Devine to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, full ball around off, smacked hard down the ground. There is a long-off in position to cut this off4.4Devine to Alyssa Healy, no run, they\\'re intent on keeping it really wide. This time, with Healy looking to swing leg-side, it works well for Devine as she gets it out of her arc, thereby inducing a thick toe-ender towards the keeper4.3Devine to Alyssa Healy, no run, width again, Healy has trouble reaching it this time and chops it off a thick under-edge behind the wickets4.2Devine to Alyssa Healy, FOUR, too much width being provided to Healy by New Zealand, and more often than not it\\'s getting punished. Short and wide, flays the cut over backward point4.1Devine to Alyssa Healy, no run, back of a length wide of off, flat-batted off the toe-end to extra cover3.6Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, short of length, Healy was advancing down looking to heave it away but can only drag it wide of midwicket for a single3.5Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, no run, almost yorker length on off, jammed to mid-on3.4Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, no run, patted into the covers3.3Tahuhu to Beth Mooney, 1 run, short of length on off, patted to cover-point and they set off for the single. Could\\'ve been hazardous with a clean pick-up, but there\\'s a misfield3.2Tahuhu to Beth Mooney, no run, back of a length on off, may have stopped in the pitch slightly. Mooney was looking to clip it through the on-side, proves unsuccessful3.1Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, short of length on off, cramps Healy and even gets big on her, before taking a thick outside edge past backward point2.6Devine to Beth Mooney, FOUR, full outside off, throws her bat at it and the outside edge flies to the right of third man. Desperate dive there, in vain2.5Devine to Beth Mooney, no run, full on off, driven to mid-off2.4Devine to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, oh dear, Kerr has dropped a simple chance at cover. Full ball outside off, it\\'s pretty wide and Healy can only get the toe-end of her bat onto it. It lobs up to the left of Kerr, quite a dolly really, and down it goes2.4Devine to Alyssa Healy, wide, pretty wide outside off, not the toughest call for the umpire2.3Devine to Beth Mooney, 1 run, back of a length on leg, swings it away to deep backward square2.2Devine to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, back of a length on middle, punches it to the left of mid-on2.1Devine to Alyssa Healy, FOUR, Healy off to a bit of a flier, relishing the opportunities to free her arms. Not that there was a great deal of width on this, but she stays leg-side of the ball and carves it through pointSophie Devine, right-arm medium, comes into the attack1.6Tahuhu to Beth Mooney, no run, short and wide, Mooney chases to cut but doesn\\'t connect1.5Tahuhu to Beth Mooney, no run, back of a length, zips through and strikes Mooney\\'s pad as she\\'s late on the clip. Had pitched outside leg1.4Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, yorker length outside off, squeezed away to third man1.3Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, FOUR, two balls for Healy so far, both cut shots, both crisp and this one races to the fence. Short of length outside off, she slaps it through the covers. Poor delivery really1.2Tahuhu to Beth Mooney, 1 run, short of length outside off, Mooney finds the gap through a packed backward point region. Glides it to third man1.1Tahuhu to Beth Mooney, no run, short of length on off, blocked into the off-sideLea Tahuhu, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack0.6Amelia Kerr to Beth Mooney, 1 run, leading edge pops back over Kerr\\'s head, out of her reach. Mooney having lots of trouble with the googly, then has to take the trouble of diving for her crease at the non-striker\\'s end with mid-on attacking the ball0.5Amelia Kerr to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, short ball outside off, slapped to sweeper cover0.4Amelia Kerr to Beth Mooney, 1 run, nudges this through midwicket0.3Amelia Kerr to Beth Mooney, no run, deceived by the googly again, this time looking to work through the on-side and getting a thick leading edge0.2Amelia Kerr to Beth Mooney, no run, didn\\'t pick the googly, beaten by a long way! Pitched on off and turned away while Mooney was stuck on the crease, poking at it0.1Amelia Kerr to Beth Mooney, no run, short ball spinning down leg, Kerr\\'s lucky that Mooney has hit her pull straight to short fine leg. Few yards either side and it would\\'ve raced awayBeth Mooney and Alyssa Healy are at the crease. Beth Mooney is on strike. Amelia Kerr will open the attackThe national anthems are done.

The action continues tomorrow as well. Do join us back. Until then, goodbye from us here.Meg Lanning, Australian captain: It\\'s a massive win for us. We were tested all the way. Really pleasing to get the win. We thought it was a par total. We felt if we could control the powerplay, we were in the game and I thought our bowlers did a fanstastic job. Taking the pace off the ball and trying to limit the boundaries, it was crucial to get the wickets at that stage. Healy has been dominating at the top with the bat and Haynes also chipped in towards the end.Amy Satterthwaite, New Zealand captain: Obviously disappointed with the loss. In all three facets of the game, we were outplayed. It was brilliant to see her (Suzie Bates) in form and she has been consistent for us over the years. But we needed someone to score runs at the other end. We didn\\'t execute our plans, there are glimpses of hope with the bat, just need them to step up at the right time.The Southern Stars book their spot in the Semi-Finals. Their 11th straight win in T20Is, on the contrary, 7th loss in a row for the White Ferns. On paper, it was a clash between the No. 1 and No. 2 ranked teams in the world but in the end, it was evident that there was a vast difference between the quality of these two teams. New Zealand were rattled early in their pursuit of 154, losing three wickets for 13. Bates and Martin launched a counter-attack with a 66-run partnership for the fourth wicket, keeping New Zealand in the hunt. But with Australian bowlers keeping things in check, pressure was mounting on the duo to up the ante. In search of big shots, both batswomen perished. New Zealand lost wickets in clusters from thereon and never really recovered. Presentations coming up.Alyssa Healy, Player of the Match: Just really pumped. The Kiwis were always going to come hard, they needed the win. Worked really hard on my batting, opened a new area of the ground that I can access if need be. Kiwis bowled really well in that middle period but 150 was always going to be tough to get. Might be a round of golf coming. Been a tough six weeks away from home. Looking forward to the game against India.17.3Sophie Molineux to Amelia Kerr, out Caught by Haynes!! Oh, what a catch. Sums up Australia\\'s fielding today, barring that blip from Kimmince, they have been outstanding in the field today. Molineux floated it well wide of off after seeing Kerr move across to the off-side. Went for the cut and hits it uppishly to the left of point where Haynes takes a sharp low catch. Australia win by 33 runs. Amelia Kerr c Haynes b Sophie Molineux 3(4)Sophie Molineux to Amelia Kerr, THAT\\'S OUT!! Caught!!17.2Sophie Molineux to Tahuhu, 1 run, wristed away to long-on17.1Sophie Molineux to Amelia Kerr, 1 run, Kerr shimmies out and tucks it behind squareSophie Molineux [3.0-0-18-1] is back into the attack16.6Schutt to Tahuhu, no run, full on off, Tahuhu blocks itLea Tahuhu, right handed bat, comes to the crease16.5Schutt to Hannah Rowe, out Bowled!! Gone! Southern Stars inching closer to victory. Leg-cutter that griped and straightened off the deck, Rowe advances and exposes all the stumps, ends up missing the cross-batted hoick. Hears the death rattle. Hannah Rowe b Schutt 4(8)Schutt to Hannah Rowe, THAT\\'S OUT!! Bowled!!16.4Schutt to Amelia Kerr, 1 run, helped towards backward square leg and it falls safe. Seemed like a top-edge as Kerr wanted to ramp it over the fielder at 4516.3Schutt to Hannah Rowe, 1 run, oh dear, Kimmince drops a dolly at mid-off. Flat-batted on the rise, Kimmince probably didn\\'t pick it and misjudged it. Grasses it onto the turf16.2Schutt to Amelia Kerr, 1 run, pitched up outside off, Kerr checks her defence to extra coverAmelia Kerr, right handed bat, comes to the crease16.1Schutt to Kasperek, out Caught by Haynes!! Last rites underway here. Schutt comes back and strikes in her new spell. Back of a length outside off, Kasperek charges out and scythes it straight to point. Haynes didn\\'t have to move an inch. Kasperek c Haynes b Schutt 12(7) [4s-2]Schutt to Kasperek, THAT\\'S OUT!! Caught!!Megan Schutt [2.0-0-9-1] is back into the attack15.6Delissa Kimmince to Kasperek, 1 run, direct-hit at the striker\\'s end and Kasperek was gone. Went for the cut and gets an outside edge to short third man. Was looking for a single and strolled half-way down the track before being sent back by Rowe. Kasperek turns and rushes in, but the throw misses the target. They eventually steal the run, courtesy overthrows15.5Delissa Kimmince to Hannah Rowe, 1 run, whipped off the pads to deep mid-wicket15.4Delissa Kimmince to Hannah Rowe, no run, leg-cutter, Rowe shuffles across and wears it on the pad15.3Delissa Kimmince to Kasperek, 1 run, sinks low and drags the slog-sweep to deep square leg15.2Delissa Kimmince to Hannah Rowe, 1 run, fuller length delivery outside off, driven to mid-off15.1Delissa Kimmince to Hannah Rowe, no run, cutter outside off, Rowe chases and can\\'t connect14.6Gardner to Kasperek, FOUR, oh, what a shot. Kasperek can bat, she certainly can. Engineers room by backing away to leg and opens up the off-side field by carving it over cover14.6Gardner to Kasperek, 3 wides, looped down leg, Kasperek misses the sweep and the ball clicks Healy\\'s pad before rolling away towards fine leg14.5Gardner to Kasperek, FOUR, edged and four. New Zealand want more of these. Fuller outside off, Kasperek throws her bat and a thick outside runs past short third man14.4Gardner to Hannah Rowe, 1 run, flicked away to long-on14.3Gardner to Hannah Rowe, no run, oh, almost had another one. Quicker and just outside off, Rowe pokes and missesHannah Rowe, right handed bat, comes to the crease14.2Gardner to Bates, out Lbw!! This should be the game. Bates departs and New Zealand\\'s hopes diminishes. Flat and skiddier, Bates came running down the track and ends up playing all over it. Gets rapped low on the pad, Healy went up straightaway, Gardner wasn\\'t too keen. But umpire Shaun George took his time before raising the finger. Good call as HawkEye shows that it was clipping the middle and leg stump. Bates lbw b Gardner 48(42) [4s-4 6s-1]Gardner to Bates, THAT\\'S OUT!!

The batswomen didn\\'t want to risk the second thereLeigh Kasperek, right handed bat, comes to the crease13.5Delissa Kimmince to Bezuidenhout, out Caught by Alyssa Healy!! Two wickets in a span of four balls and New Zealand are stuttering here. Short and rising outside off, Bezuidenhout was waiting to guide it to third man.

Safe as houses is Perry. New Zealand lose half their side now. It was drifted on leg, Green was early into the pick-up shot. Gets a leading edge which balloons up to deep mid-wicket. Perry takes care of the rest. Maddy Green c Perry b Delissa Kimmince 8(7) [4s-1]Delissa Kimmince to Maddy Green, THAT\\'S OUT!!

Tossed up above the eyeline, Bates gets underneath it to smoke it over the bowler\\'s head11.5Georgia Wareham to Maddy Green, 1 run, pushed towards cover11.4Georgia Wareham to Maddy Green, FOUR, wow! What a way to get off the mark. Camps back and muscles it in the gap at deep mid-wicketMaddy Green, right handed bat, comes to the crease11.3Georgia Wareham to Katey Martin, out Stumped!! Wonderfully done. Wareham takes her revenge after getting hit for a boundary of the first ball. Well-flighted and lured Martin forward before dipping it late. Martin is yorked and lost her balance, dragging her back leg out of the crease. Healy calmly dislodges the bails quickly. Katey Martin st Alyssa Healy b Georgia Wareham 24(20) [4s-3]Georgia Wareham to Katey Martin, THAT\\'S OUT!! Stumped!!Has Healy pulled off a smart stumping here?

Should\\'ve been taken. Short of length, trumps Bates who had charged down looking to swing. Results in a top-edge that flies over the keeper. She got both hands on it9.3Perry to Katey Martin, 1 run, short of length outside off, dabs it to the left of short third man who has to put in the dive9.2Perry to Katey Martin, FOUR, full on off, little shimmy from Martin before swiping this over midwicket.

Misses the reverse-paddle, struck in front of off. The pressure is getting to New Zealand Women, clouding their judgements.

Rams into middle stump after nipping through the gate. It\\'s a cracking start with the ball for Australia.

Not a great shot this early in the innings. Short of length, Peterson looks to swipe it away cross-batted but it dips underneath and hits her on the thigh. She was quite low while playing the shot, so despite getting hit above the pad, the height won\\'t save her as she would\\'ve hoped while going for the review. This is crashing into middle and leg. New Zealand lose their review in the first over itself. Anna Peterson lbw b Schutt 0(2)Schutt to Anna Peterson, THAT\\'S OUT!!

Bates is on strike. Schutt will open the attackWelcome back. Can New Zealand carry the momentum which they gained towards the end of their bowling effort?First 10 overs: 82 runs, 1 wicket. Last 10 overs: 71 runs, 6 wickets. Extraordinary comeback from the White Ferns in the second half. Alyssa Healy made most of her purple patch, recording a hat-trick of fifties. Mooney gave her good company and Australia were off to a good start. But once Healy fell, they lost their way as New Zealand bowlers chipped in with regular intervals, which put the breaks on the scoring rate. Rachael Haynes gave the required boost in the end to lift Australia over the 150-run mark. Leigh Kasperek was the pick of the bowlers for the White Ferns with three wickets. With the dew setting in, it\\'s advantage Kiwis going into the break. Stay tuned, we will be back shortly.19.6Devine to Sophie Molineux, out Caught by Amelia Kerr!! straight to point. So, a wicket off the final ball of the innings. Shortish outside off, Molineux went across and dinked it airly, fails to pick the gap and hits it to Kerr at backward point.

Kerr resurrects her karm charts after dropping a sitter earlier. Third wicket for Kasperek, who has bowled beautifully today. Enticed Perry by tossing it up, Perry wanted to slog it across and lost her shape a bit. Fat top-edge is found and Kerr clasps onto it at point.

Bowls a length delivery well outside off. Haynes chases and gets an outside edge which runs away to the third man fence. The fielder was inside the ring, so it was easy-peasy..17.1Tahuhu to Haynes, FOUR, pulled away witheringly in the gap. Short at the torso, Haynes took it on the front foot and controlled the pull all along the ground, bisecting two fielders in the deep on the leg-sideLea Tahuhu [3.0-0-14-0] is back into the attack16.6Amelia Kerr to Perry, no run, tossed up outside off, Perry makes room after charging down the track and drives it to extra cover16.5Amelia Kerr to Haynes, 1 run, skips out and heaves it off the inner half to deep mid-wicket16.4Amelia Kerr to Perry, 1 run, Perry uses her feet aiming to go over extra cover, the ball spins in and takes the inner half to trickle towards mid-wicket16.3Amelia Kerr to Perry, no run, throat-clearing appeal for LBW, not given. White Ferns challenge the decision. Fair delivery. It was the googly from Kerr, Perry came forward to defend without reading the wrong \\'un. Only question is if it is hitting the stumps? Nope, missing leg. Good call from the on-field umpire there16.2Amelia Kerr to Haynes, 1 run, rushes out and hoicks it through the line towards long-on16.1Amelia Kerr to Haynes, FOUR, nice shot from Haynes.

My word, Bates almost shelled a sitter but shows tremendous presence of mind to hold onto it in the end. Gardner gambols out seeking for a biggie and hits it towards long-on. No power whatsoever behind the shot and straight to Bates, who went reverse-cupped. The ball bursts through her hands to hit her face, pops up in the air and Bates tries to take it on the rebound. Falls back, loses her balance and cushions it on her chest. After juggling twice, she manages to cling onto it in the third attempt. They went upstairs to check if it was clean catch as well.

This is brutal from Healy7.2Hannah Rowe to Beth Mooney, 1 run, full ball slanted in on middle and leg, whipped out to deep midwicket7.1Hannah Rowe to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, floaty full ball on off, pushes it through the coversHannah Rowe, right-arm medium, comes into the attack6.6Amelia Kerr to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, bit short with the googly, Healy rocks back and pulls to deep midwicket6.5Amelia Kerr to Beth Mooney, 1 run, loopy full toss, flicked down to long-on6.4Amelia Kerr to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, short outside off, slapped to sweeper cover6.3Amelia Kerr to Beth Mooney, 1 run, overpitched, smeared to long-off6.2Amelia Kerr to Beth Mooney, FOUR, mid-on is inside the ring, and this juicy full toss from Kerr is at the mercy of Mooney. She dances down and smokes it to the long-on boundary6.1Amelia Kerr to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, flat googly towards off, stabbed wide of coverAmelia Kerr [1.0-0-3-0] is back into the attack5.6Kasperek to Beth Mooney, FOUR, she\\'s got a nice piece of this.

Poor start to Kasperek\\'s spell, drifting it down leg, and Healy is severe with her swipe through backward squareLeigh Kasperek, right-arm off break, comes into the attack4.6Devine to Beth Mooney, FOUR, flicked over the infield by Mooney, who hasn\\'t looked at ease out there, but this should settle her down4.5Devine to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, full ball around off, smacked hard down the ground. There is a long-off in position to cut this off4.4Devine to Alyssa Healy, no run, they\\'re intent on keeping it really wide. This time, with Healy looking to swing leg-side, it works well for Devine as she gets it out of her arc, thereby inducing a thick toe-ender towards the keeper4.3Devine to Alyssa Healy, no run, width again, Healy has trouble reaching it this time and chops it off a thick under-edge behind the wickets4.2Devine to Alyssa Healy, FOUR, too much width being provided to Healy by New Zealand, and more often than not it\\'s getting punished. Short and wide, flays the cut over backward point4.1Devine to Alyssa Healy, no run, back of a length wide of off, flat-batted off the toe-end to extra cover3.6Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, short of length, Healy was advancing down looking to heave it away but can only drag it wide of midwicket for a single3.5Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, no run, almost yorker length on off, jammed to mid-on3.4Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, no run, patted into the covers3.3Tahuhu to Beth Mooney, 1 run, short of length on off, patted to cover-point and they set off for the single. Could\\'ve been hazardous with a clean pick-up, but there\\'s a misfield3.2Tahuhu to Beth Mooney, no run, back of a length on off, may have stopped in the pitch slightly. Mooney was looking to clip it through the on-side, proves unsuccessful3.1Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, short of length on off, cramps Healy and even gets big on her, before taking a thick outside edge past backward point2.6Devine to Beth Mooney, FOUR, full outside off, throws her bat at it and the outside edge flies to the right of third man. Desperate dive there, in vain2.5Devine to Beth Mooney, no run, full on off, driven to mid-off2.4Devine to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, oh dear, Kerr has dropped a simple chance at cover. Full ball outside off, it\\'s pretty wide and Healy can only get the toe-end of her bat onto it. It lobs up to the left of Kerr, quite a dolly really, and down it goes2.4Devine to Alyssa Healy, wide, pretty wide outside off, not the toughest call for the umpire2.3Devine to Beth Mooney, 1 run, back of a length on leg, swings it away to deep backward square2.2Devine to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, back of a length on middle, punches it to the left of mid-on2.1Devine to Alyssa Healy, FOUR, Healy off to a bit of a flier, relishing the opportunities to free her arms. Not that there was a great deal of width on this, but she stays leg-side of the ball and carves it through pointSophie Devine, right-arm medium, comes into the attack1.6Tahuhu to Beth Mooney, no run, short and wide, Mooney chases to cut but doesn\\'t connect1.5Tahuhu to Beth Mooney, no run, back of a length, zips through and strikes Mooney\\'s pad as she\\'s late on the clip. Had pitched outside leg1.4Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, yorker length outside off, squeezed away to third man1.3Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, FOUR, two balls for Healy so far, both cut shots, both crisp and this one races to the fence. Short of length outside off, she slaps it through the covers. Poor delivery really1.2Tahuhu to Beth Mooney, 1 run, short of length outside off, Mooney finds the gap through a packed backward point region. Glides it to third man1.1Tahuhu to Beth Mooney, no run, short of length on off, blocked into the off-sideLea Tahuhu, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack0.6Amelia Kerr to Beth Mooney, 1 run, leading edge pops back over Kerr\\'s head, out of her reach. Mooney having lots of trouble with the googly, then has to take the trouble of diving for her crease at the non-striker\\'s end with mid-on attacking the ball0.5Amelia Kerr to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, short ball outside off, slapped to sweeper cover0.4Amelia Kerr to Beth Mooney, 1 run, nudges this through midwicket0.3Amelia Kerr to Beth Mooney, no run, deceived by the googly again, this time looking to work through the on-side and getting a thick leading edge0.2Amelia Kerr to Beth Mooney, no run, didn\\'t pick the googly, beaten by a long way! Pitched on off and turned away while Mooney was stuck on the crease, poking at it0.1Amelia Kerr to Beth Mooney, no run, short ball spinning down leg, Kerr\\'s lucky that Mooney has hit her pull straight to short fine leg. Few yards either side and it would\\'ve raced awayBeth Mooney and Alyssa Healy are at the crease. Beth Mooney is on strike. Amelia Kerr will open the attackThe national anthems are done. Out walk the two opening batters while New Zealand Women disperse from their huddle. There\\'ve been two strong batting performances from the Australian Women so far. Will it be a third?Teams:New Zealand Women (Playing XI): Suzie Bates, Anna Peterson, Sophie Devine, Amy Satterthwaite(c), Katey Martin(w), Maddy Green, Bernadine Bezuidenhout, Leigh Kasperek, Hannah Rowe, Amelia Kerr, Lea TahuhuAustralia Women (Playing XI): Alyssa Healy(w), Beth Mooney, Ellyse Perry, Meg Lanning(c), Ashleigh Gardner, Elyse Villani, Rachael Haynes, Sophie Molineux, Delissa Kimmince, Georgia Wareham, Megan SchuttSatterthwaite, NZ Women captain: Just the consistency of putting it altogether is lacking. We were happy to have a bowl. Under lights it starts to skid on a little bit more. Two changes today.Lanning, Australia Women captain: Going to have a bat tonight. Wicket seemed to have played well in the game earlier today. Going in with the same team.Australia Women have won the toss and have opted to batIt\\'s a battle between two antipodean nations. Welcome to game 10 of ICC Women\\'s World T20 2018 between Australia Women and New Zealand Women. The Southern Stars have had a great start to the tournament with two wins in two games and they are certainly living up to the favourites tag. Alyssa Healy has been in the form of her life and she remains a vital cog in Australia\\'s batting. Meanwhile, the loss to India in the first match has put White Ferns in a must-win situation and they will be desperate to get their campaign off and running today. Toss and teams in a short while.Teams:Australia Women (From): Alyssa Healy(w), Beth Mooney, Ellyse Perry, Meg Lanning(c), Ashleigh Gardner, Elyse Villani, Rachael Haynes, Sophie Molineux, Delissa Kimmince, Georgia Wareham, Megan Schutt, Nicole Bolton, Tayla Vlaeminck, Nicola CareyNew Zealand Women (From): Suzie Bates, Anna Peterson, Sophie Devine, Jess Watkin, Amy Satterthwaite(c), Katey Martin(w), Maddy Green, Leigh Kasperek, Hayley Jensen, Amelia Kerr, Lea Tahuhu, Bernadine Bezuidenhout, KE Ebrahim, Holly Huddleston, Hannah Rowe  LATEST NEWS   Blow to the neck brought back memories of Phillip Hughes for Steve Smith4h ago    Haynes to captain Sydney Thunder in upcoming WBBL season5h ago  Feroz Shah Kotla stadium to be renamed after Arun Jaitley7h ago  Keemo Paul replaces Miguel Cummins for Jamaica Test9h ago  Uthappa to lead Kerala in shorter formats10h ago  More News    .cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;} .cb-list-heading{font-weight:normal!important} ,  Australia Women vs New Zealand Women, 10th Match, Group B - Live Cricket Score, Commentary   Series:  ICC Womens World T20 2018 Venue: Providence Stadium,Guyana Date &amp; Time: Nov 13,\\xa008:00 PM\\xa0LOCAL    Commentary Scorecard Highlights  Full Commentary Live Blog Points Table Match Facts News Photos ,  Series:  ICC Womens World T20 2018 Venue: Providence Stadium,Guyana Date &amp; Time: Nov 13,\\xa008:00 PM\\xa0LOCAL  ,     AUSW 153/7 (20) NZW 120/10 (17.3)    Australia Women won by 33 runs  PLAYER OF THE MATCH Alyssa Healy   BatsmanRB4s6sSRBowlerOMRWECO&nbsp;*Have Your SayPLAYER OF THE MATCHPLAYER OF THE SERIES.cb-min-vid{background: #000; color:#fff; padding:5px; height:54px; overflow: hidden; margin:0px -10px 0 0;}That\\'s it from today. The action continues tomorrow as well. Do join us back. Until then, goodbye from us here.Meg Lanning, Australian captain: It\\'s a massive win for us. We were tested all the way. Really pleasing to get the win. We thought it was a par total. We felt if we could control the powerplay, we were in the game and I thought our bowlers did a fanstastic job. Taking the pace off the ball and trying to limit the boundaries, it was crucial to get the wickets at that stage. Healy has been dominating at the top with the bat and Haynes also chipped in towards the end.Amy Satterthwaite, New Zealand captain: Obviously disappointed with the loss. In all three facets of the game, we were outplayed. It was brilliant to see her (Suzie Bates) in form and she has been consistent for us over the years. But we needed someone to score runs at the other end. We didn\\'t execute our plans, there are glimpses of hope with the bat, just need them to step up at the right time.The Southern Stars book their spot in the Semi-Finals. Their 11th straight win in T20Is, on the contrary, 7th loss in a row for the White Ferns. On paper, it was a clash between the No. 1 and No. 2 ranked teams in the world but in the end, it was evident that there was a vast difference between the quality of these two teams. New Zealand were rattled early in their pursuit of 154, losing three wickets for 13. Bates and Martin launched a counter-attack with a 66-run partnership for the fourth wicket, keeping New Zealand in the hunt. But with Australian bowlers keeping things in check, pressure was mounting on the duo to up the ante. In search of big shots, both batswomen perished. New Zealand lost wickets in clusters from thereon and never really recovered. Presentations coming up.Alyssa Healy, Player of the Match: Just really pumped. The Kiwis were always going to come hard, they needed the win. Worked really hard on my batting, opened a new area of the ground that I can access if need be. Kiwis bowled really well in that middle period but 150 was always going to be tough to get. Might be a round of golf coming. Been a tough six weeks away from home. Looking forward to the game against India.17.3Sophie Molineux to Amelia Kerr, out Caught by Haynes!! Oh, what a catch. Sums up Australia\\'s fielding today, barring that blip from Kimmince, they have been outstanding in the field today. Molineux floated it well wide of off after seeing Kerr move across to the off-side. Went for the cut and hits it uppishly to the left of point where Haynes takes a sharp low catch. Australia win by 33 runs. Amelia Kerr c Haynes b Sophie Molineux 3(4)Sophie Molineux to Amelia Kerr, THAT\\'S OUT!!

Gone! Southern Stars inching closer to victory. Leg-cutter that griped and straightened off the deck, Rowe advances and exposes all the stumps, ends up missing the cross-batted hoick. Hears the death rattle. Hannah Rowe b Schutt 4(8)Schutt to Hannah Rowe, THAT\\'S OUT!! Bowled!!16.4Schutt to Amelia Kerr, 1 run, helped towards backward square leg and it falls safe. Seemed like a top-edge as Kerr wanted to ramp it over the fielder at 4516.3Schutt to Hannah Rowe, 1 run, oh dear, Kimmince drops a dolly at mid-off. Flat-batted on the rise, Kimmince probably didn\\'t pick it and misjudged it. Grasses it onto the turf16.2Schutt to Amelia Kerr, 1 run, pitched up outside off, Kerr checks her defence to extra coverAmelia Kerr, right handed bat, comes to the crease16.1Schutt to Kasperek, out Caught by Haynes!! Last rites underway here. Schutt comes back and strikes in her new spell. Back of a length outside off, Kasperek charges out and scythes it straight to point. Haynes didn\\'t have to move an inch. Kasperek c Haynes b Schutt 12(7) [4s-2]Schutt to Kasperek, THAT\\'S OUT!! Caught!!Megan Schutt [2.0-0-9-1] is back into the attack15.6Delissa Kimmince to Kasperek, 1 run, direct-hit at the striker\\'s end and Kasperek was gone. Went for the cut and gets an outside edge to short third man. Was looking for a single and strolled half-way down the track before being sent back by Rowe. Kasperek turns and rushes in, but the throw misses the target. They eventually steal the run, courtesy overthrows15.5Delissa Kimmince to Hannah Rowe, 1 run, whipped off the pads to deep mid-wicket15.4Delissa Kimmince to Hannah Rowe, no run, leg-cutter, Rowe shuffles across and wears it on the pad15.3Delissa Kimmince to Kasperek, 1 run, sinks low and drags the slog-sweep to deep square leg15.2Delissa Kimmince to Hannah Rowe, 1 run, fuller length delivery outside off, driven to mid-off15.1Delissa Kimmince to Hannah Rowe, no run, cutter outside off, Rowe chases and can\\'t connect14.6Gardner to Kasperek, FOUR, oh, what a shot. Kasperek can bat, she certainly can. Engineers room by backing away to leg and opens up the off-side field by carving it over cover14.6Gardner to Kasperek, 3 wides, looped down leg, Kasperek misses the sweep and the ball clicks Healy\\'s pad before rolling away towards fine leg14.5Gardner to Kasperek, FOUR, edged and four. New Zealand want more of these. Fuller outside off, Kasperek throws her bat and a thick outside runs past short third man14.4Gardner to Hannah Rowe, 1 run, flicked away to long-on14.3Gardner to Hannah Rowe, no run, oh, almost had another one. Quicker and just outside off, Rowe pokes and missesHannah Rowe, right handed bat, comes to the crease14.2Gardner to Bates, out Lbw!! This should be the game. Bates departs and New Zealand\\'s hopes diminishes. Flat and skiddier, Bates came running down the track and ends up playing all over it. Gets rapped low on the pad, Healy went up straightaway, Gardner wasn\\'t too keen. But umpire Shaun George took his time before raising the finger. Good call as HawkEye shows that it was clipping the middle and leg stump. Bates lbw b Gardner 48(42) [4s-4 6s-1]Gardner to Bates, THAT\\'S OUT!! Lbw!!14.1Gardner to Kasperek, 1 run, bends low and brooms it away behind squareAshleigh Gardner [1.0-0-4-0] is back into the attack56 runs in 36 balls. White Ferns\\' will be banking on Bates\\' special here.13.6Delissa Kimmince to Kasperek, 1 run, dipping at the stumps, Kasperek clips it away to deep mid-wicket. \"Bowler, bowler\" was the shout and the throw came to the right end. The batswomen didn\\'t want to risk the second thereLeigh Kasperek, right handed bat, comes to the crease13.5Delissa Kimmince to Bezuidenhout, out Caught by Alyssa Healy!! Two wickets in a span of four balls and New Zealand are stuttering here. Short and rising outside off, Bezuidenhout was waiting to guide it to third man. Feathers a nick and Healy nestles in her glove. Australia on top. Bezuidenhout c Alyssa Healy b Delissa Kimmince 1(2)Delissa Kimmince to Bezuidenhout, THAT\\'S OUT!! Caught!!13.4Delissa Kimmince to Bates, 1 run, spectacular stop by Lanning at extra cover.

Safe as houses is Perry. New Zealand lose half their side now. It was drifted on leg, Green was early into the pick-up shot. Gets a leading edge which balloons up to deep mid-wicket. Perry takes care of the rest. Maddy Green c Perry b Delissa Kimmince 8(7) [4s-1]Delissa Kimmince to Maddy Green, THAT\\'S OUT!!

Tossed up above the eyeline, Bates gets underneath it to smoke it over the bowler\\'s head11.5Georgia Wareham to Maddy Green, 1 run, pushed towards cover11.4Georgia Wareham to Maddy Green, FOUR, wow! What a way to get off the mark. Camps back and muscles it in the gap at deep mid-wicketMaddy Green, right handed bat, comes to the crease11.3Georgia Wareham to Katey Martin, out Stumped!! Wonderfully done. Wareham takes her revenge after getting hit for a boundary of the first ball. Well-flighted and lured Martin forward before dipping it late. Martin is yorked and lost her balance, dragging her back leg out of the crease. Healy calmly dislodges the bails quickly. Katey Martin st Alyssa Healy b Georgia Wareham 24(20) [4s-3]Georgia Wareham to Katey Martin, THAT\\'S OUT!! Stumped!!Has Healy pulled off a smart stumping here? She looks very convinced but the square leg umpire has sent the matter upstairs. Fair delivery. Oh, yes. Martin is gone.11.2Georgia Wareham to Katey Martin, no run, quicker and came in with the arm, Martin waits and taps it to point11.1Georgia Wareham to Katey Martin, FOUR, half-tracker and Martin takes toll.

Should\\'ve been taken. Short of length, trumps Bates who had charged down looking to swing. Results in a top-edge that flies over the keeper. She got both hands on it9.3Perry to Katey Martin, 1 run, short of length outside off, dabs it to the left of short third man who has to put in the dive9.2Perry to Katey Martin, FOUR, full on off, little shimmy from Martin before swiping this over midwicket.

What desperation to stop the boundary. Bates\\'s slog-sweep looked set to beat her at long-on, but she threw herself across to cut it off7.4Delissa Kimmince to Katey Martin, 1 run, back of a length outside off, dabs it through point7.3Delissa Kimmince to Katey Martin, 2 runs, makes room and crashes it off the stumps through extra cover.

Brushes off her thigh and ricochets off the keeper\\'s gloves to short third man. Casual running from Bates, didn\\'t expect a throw at her end and a direct-hit would\\'ve got her6.5Georgia Wareham to Bates, 2 runs, short ball turning away outside off, Bates slaps it wide of sweeper cover6.4Georgia Wareham to Katey Martin, 1 run, flighted leg-break, swept to deep backward square6.3Georgia Wareham to Bates, 1 run, eases it down to long-on6.2Georgia Wareham to Bates, no run, Wareham pushes this flatter, skids through onto Bates\\'s pad as she\\'s beaten thoroughly on the pull6.1Georgia Wareham to Katey Martin, 1 run, flighted up at the stumps, driven to long-on6.1Georgia Wareham to Katey Martin, 3 wides, not a great start from Wareham, slipping well down the leg-side and beating her keeper tooGeorgia Wareham, right-arm medium, comes into the attack5.6Sophie Molineux to Katey Martin, 1 run, darted in with the arm, nudges it wide of midwicket5.5Sophie Molineux to Bates, 1 run, sliding in with the arm, chipped towards midwicket, falls slightly short5.4Sophie Molineux to Bates, no run, flat at the stumps, punched back5.3Sophie Molineux to Bates, no run, fired wide of off, spotting Bates\\'s charge.

Misses the reverse-paddle, struck in front of off. The pressure is getting to New Zealand Women, clouding their judgements.

Not a great shot this early in the innings. Short of length, Peterson looks to swipe it away cross-batted but it dips underneath and hits her on the thigh. She was quite low while playing the shot, so despite getting hit above the pad, the height won\\'t save her as she would\\'ve hoped while going for the review. This is crashing into middle and leg.

Last 10 overs: 71 runs, 6 wickets. Extraordinary comeback from the White Ferns in the second half. Alyssa Healy made most of her purple patch, recording a hat-trick of fifties. Mooney gave her good company and Australia were off to a good start. But once Healy fell, they lost their way as New Zealand bowlers chipped in with regular intervals, which put the breaks on the scoring rate. Rachael Haynes gave the required boost in the end to lift Australia over the 150-run mark. Leigh Kasperek was the pick of the bowlers for the White Ferns with three wickets. With the dew setting in, it\\'s advantage Kiwis going into the break. Stay tuned, we will be back shortly.19.6Devine to Sophie Molineux, out Caught by Amelia Kerr!! straight to point. So, a wicket off the final ball of the innings. Shortish outside off, Molineux went across and dinked it airly, fails to pick the gap and hits it to Kerr at backward point. Sophie Molineux c Amelia Kerr b Devine 2(4)Devine to Sophie Molineux, THAT\\'S OUT!! Caught!!19.5Devine to Haynes, 1 run, wider lines outside off, Haynes chops it to point19.4Devine to Sophie Molineux, 1 run, back of a length outside off, Molineux stays deep and guides it to third man19.3Devine to Haynes, 1 run, put down by Bates. Cutter outside off, Haynes gets under it and smacks it in the air towards deep mid-wicket. Bates bends low and shells it19.2Devine to Haynes, 2 runs, steered using Devine\\'s pace square on the off-side. Picks up a couple of runs19.1Devine to Haynes, FOUR, short and outside off, Haynes gets back and across in her crease to swat it past square legSophie Devine [3.0-0-28-1] is back into the attack18.6Kasperek to Sophie Molineux, no run, skidding on with the arm, Molineux hangs deep to flay it to backward point18.5Kasperek to Haynes, 1 run, dropped. Haynes spanks it straight back at the bowler after coming down the track. Kasperek sits down and went with both hands. But it brushed the fingertips and zoomed away to long-off18.4Kasperek to Sophie Molineux, 1 run, Molineux ventures out and extends her arms into a drive to extra cover18.3Kasperek to Haynes, 1 run, quicker outside off, punched to coverSophie Molineux, left handed bat, comes to the crease18.2Kasperek to Perry, out Caught by Amelia Kerr!! Kerr resurrects her karm charts after dropping a sitter earlier. Third wicket for Kasperek, who has bowled beautifully today. Enticed Perry by tossing it up, Perry wanted to slog it across and lost her shape a bit. Fat top-edge is found and Kerr clasps onto it at point. Perry c Amelia Kerr b Kasperek 3(6)Kasperek to Perry, THAT\\'S OUT!! Caught!!18.1Kasperek to Haynes, 1 run, flighted delivery outside off, driven to long-offLeigh Kasperek [3.0-0-21-2] is back into the attack17.6Tahuhu to Perry, no run, off-pace delivery, Perry waits deep to glide it to point17.5Tahuhu to Perry, 2 runs, pitched up outside off, Perry slices the drive to point, misfield will allow them to pinch the second run17.4Tahuhu to Haynes, 1 run, goes searching for a cut, hits it to point and steals a quick single17.3Tahuhu to Haynes, no run, fuller on leg, wristed to mid-wicket17.2Tahuhu to Haynes, FOUR, poor, poor delivery from Tahuhu. Bowls a length delivery well outside off. Haynes chases and gets an outside edge which runs away to the third man fence. The fielder was inside the ring, so it was easy-peasy..17.1Tahuhu to Haynes, FOUR, pulled away witheringly in the gap. Short at the torso, Haynes took it on the front foot and controlled the pull all along the ground, bisecting two fielders in the deep on the leg-sideLea Tahuhu [3.0-0-14-0] is back into the attack16.6Amelia Kerr to Perry, no run, tossed up outside off, Perry makes room after charging down the track and drives it to extra cover16.5Amelia Kerr to Haynes, 1 run, skips out and heaves it off the inner half to deep mid-wicket16.4Amelia Kerr to Perry, 1 run, Perry uses her feet aiming to go over extra cover, the ball spins in and takes the inner half to trickle towards mid-wicket16.3Amelia Kerr to Perry, no run, throat-clearing appeal for LBW, not given. White Ferns challenge the decision. Fair delivery. It was the googly from Kerr, Perry came forward to defend without reading the wrong \\'un. Only question is if it is hitting the stumps? Nope, missing leg. Good call from the on-field umpire there16.2Amelia Kerr to Haynes, 1 run, rushes out and hoicks it through the line towards long-on16.1Amelia Kerr to Haynes, FOUR, nice shot from Haynes. Flighted on middle, Haynes scooches low and sweeps it in the gap between deep square leg and deep mid-wicketAmelia Kerr [3.0-0-18-0] is back into the attackEllyse Perry, right handed bat, comes to the crease15.6Anna Peterson to Villani, out Lbw!! White Ferns are chipping away at the wickets. Tossed up outside off, spins in and raps Villani on the pad, who was preempting the sweep. Missed the line of the delivery and paid the price. Villani lbw b Anna Peterson 14(11) [4s-2]Anna Peterson to Villani, THAT\\'S OUT!! Lbw!!Villani is given out LBW, she consults with her partner and reviews. Over to third umpire. No issues with the front foot. No bat there, confirms UltraEdge. Pitching - outside off. Impact - umpire\\'s call. Wickets - hitting. Says HawkEye. OUT.15.6Anna Peterson to Villani, wide, slipping down leg, wided15.5Anna Peterson to Villani, no run, saw the batswoman come down the track, Peterson pulled her length back and cramped Villani for room. Inside-edges it to square leg15.4Anna Peterson to Haynes, 1 run, Haynes chips out and ends up getting an outside edge which dips in front of short third man. Wayward throw to the keeper\\'s end and they will take the single15.3Anna Peterson to Villani, 1 run, swept away behind square15.2Anna Peterson to Villani, FOUR, and again.. spotted the flighted delivery early, jumps down the track and lofts it elegantly over mid-off15.1Anna Peterson to Villani, FOUR, just over mid-off\\'s head. Villani creates her own room and hammers it beautifullyAnna Peterson, right-arm off break, comes into the attack14.6Kasperek to Haynes, no run, appeal for LBW, but only the keeper is excited. Slower and Haynes sits down to sweep. The ball rears up and pings the flap of the pad14.5Kasperek to Haynes, no run, chipped back uppishly, just short of the bowler14.4Kasperek to Haynes, 2 runs, Haynes takes a cue from her partner and directs it very fine with a paddle14.3Kasperek to Villani, 1 run, swept away it fine legRachael Haynes, left handed bat, comes to the crease14.2Kasperek to Gardner, out Caught by Bates!! My word, Bates almost shelled a sitter but shows tremendous presence of mind to hold onto it in the end. Gardner gambols out seeking for a biggie and hits it towards long-on. No power whatsoever behind the shot and straight to Bates, who went reverse-cupped. The ball bursts through her hands to hit her face, pops up in the air and Bates tries to take it on the rebound. Falls back, loses her balance and cushions it on her chest. After juggling twice, she manages to cling onto it in the third attempt. They went upstairs to check if it was clean catch as well. Gardner c Bates b Kasperek 10(13) [4s-1]Kasperek to Gardner, THAT\\'S OUT!! Caught!!14.1Kasperek to Gardner, no run, flighted delivery, defendedLeigh Kasperek [2.0-0-18-1] is back into the attack13.6Bates to Gardner, 1 run, stabbed to mid-off for a quick single13.5Bates to Villani, 1 run, flapped down to long-on, a bit of yes-no situation. In the end, they decide against taking the second13.4Bates to Gardner, 1 run, cutter outside off, slapped to extra cover. Good stop from the White Ferns\\' skipper13.4Bates to Gardner, wide, served closer to the tramlines, Bates is penalised13.3Bates to Villani, 1 run, tucked away through square leg13.2Bates to Gardner, 1 run, swings south but the ball goes in the north direction. Courtesy a thick outside edge; pitched up outside off, Gardner wanted to lift it down the ground, plays it a tad early and outside edge flies over point13.1Bates to Villani, 1 run, aims for the toe-crusher, Villani flicks it through square leg with a closed bat face13.1Bates to Villani, wide, lousy start for Bates. Veering down the leg-sideSuzie Bates, right-arm medium, comes into the attack12.6Hannah Rowe to Villani, 1 run, clipped off the pads to deep square leg12.5Hannah Rowe to Villani, no run, short of length on middle, Villani shows her straight batElyse Villani, right handed bat, comes to the crease12.4Hannah Rowe to Alyssa Healy, out Bowled!! Cleaned up. Healy perishes. Went a long way across her sticks and Rowe just attacked the stumps. Healy couldn\\'t get any bat and misses it. The ball strikes timber and Healy combusts after a well-made fifty. Alyssa Healy b Hannah Rowe 53(38) [4s-8]Hannah Rowe to Alyssa Healy, THAT\\'S OUT!! Bowled!!12.3Hannah Rowe to Gardner, 1 run, full-faced bat knock to long-on12.2Hannah Rowe to Gardner, no run, cracked off the meat, straight to extra cover12.2Hannah Rowe to Gardner, wide, and again. This was slung it miles down leg12.2Hannah Rowe to Gardner, wide, drifting down leg, Rowe has to reload12.1Hannah Rowe to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, in order to manufacture room to go inside-out over extra cover, Healy uses her bottom-hand to drill it down to long-on unable to find the placementHannah Rowe [1.0-0-16-0] is back into the attack11.6Amelia Kerr to Gardner, no run, slowish leg-break, outside off. Gardner waits back to quell it11.5Amelia Kerr to Gardner, no run, similar delivery, albeit no bounce on this googly. Gardner is clueless and gets slammed low on the pad11.4Amelia Kerr to Gardner, no run, sharp googly, Gardner doesn\\'t pick it and the ball spins in to rap the thigh pad11.3Amelia Kerr to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, \"Catch\" was the shout but it dies in front of long-on fielder. Healy after skipping out, miscued the loft. Gets it off the toe-end, hence no power behind it11.2Amelia Kerr to Gardner, 1 run, jumps back and across to punch it away to sweeper cover11.1Amelia Kerr to Gardner, FOUR, freebie and Gardner accepts it with glee. Loopu full toss at the stumps, Gardner takes it on the full to smole it through mid-wicket. Desperate effort from long-on fielder in vainAmelia Kerr [2.0-0-12-0] is back into the attack10.6Devine to Alyssa Healy, no run, Healy was slightly moving to leg which prevented her from reaching out to this fuller length delivery that was stalking the widelines outside off10.5Devine to Gardner, 1 run, full and straight, driven down the ground to long-on10.5Devine to Gardner, wide, tries a similar sort of trickery but Gardner doesn\\'t shuffle in her crease. Lets it passAshleigh Gardner, right handed bat, comes to the crease10.4Devine to Lanning, out Caught by Katey Martin!! Big wicket for the White Ferns. Devine outfoxes Lanning. Wafted full and wide of off after seeing Lanning move across her sticks. Australian skipper went with hard hands and feeds an outside edge that is easily pouched by Martin. Lanning c Katey Martin b Devine 5(6) [4s-1]Devine to Lanning, THAT\\'S OUT!! Caught!!10.3Devine to Lanning, no run, shortish outside off, Lanning goes deep and flays it to backward point10.3Devine to Lanning, 3 wides, swinging down the leg-side, awkward bounce for the keeper and it scraps the webbing before wandering away towards fine leg10.2Devine to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, full and wide of off, Healy squeezes it to extra cover10.1Devine to Lanning, 1 run, soft-handed dab to backward pointSophie Devine [2.0-0-21-0] is back into the attack9.6Tahuhu to Lanning, leg byes, 1 run, slanted in on leg, deflects off Lanning\\'s pad behind square9.5Tahuhu to Lanning, no run, back of a length outside off, went for a repeat of that previous shot but failed to connect this time9.4Tahuhu to Lanning, FOUR, oh, what timing! Merely a steer from Lanning, has raced away past backward point9.3Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, short of length outside off, Healy takes account of this slower ball and carefully dabs it wide of cover for a single which will bring up her fifty. Power-packed performance this9.2Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, no run, checks the shot to cover9.1Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, no run, short of length outside off, wanted to dab it to third man but was beaten on the edgeLea Tahuhu [2.0-0-9-0] is back into the attack8.6Kasperek to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, tossed up on middle, mistimes the sweep behind square8.5Kasperek to Alyssa Healy, FOUR, that wicket doesn\\'t seem to have much effect on Healy, who cames bustling down looking for an inside-out hit. She wasn\\'t quite to the pitch, resulting in an outside edge flying past the keeper8.4Kasperek to Alyssa Healy, no run, dabs it to backward pointMeg Lanning, right handed bat, comes to the crease8.3Kasperek to Beth Mooney, out Caught by Bates!! Looked like a deliberate chip shot from Mooney, pretty sure her idea was to get it over extra cover, but she ended up hitting a lot straighter. Bates, at long-off, runs forward and settles for a safe catch. Beth Mooney c Bates b Kasperek 26(24) [4s-4]Kasperek to Beth Mooney, THAT\\'S OUT!! Caught!!8.2Kasperek to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, another aggressive shot from Healy, although she got this off the toe-end. Long-off cuts it off8.1Kasperek to Beth Mooney, 1 run, length ball sliding in on off, punched to long-offLeigh Kasperek [1.0-0-11-0] is back into the attack7.6Hannah Rowe to Alyssa Healy, FOUR, Healy is teeing off now. She has decided it\\'s time to go. Charges at the medium pacer and tonks it over mid-off. Danger times for New Zealand7.5Hannah Rowe to Alyssa Healy, 2 runs, full at the pads, flicked in between two fielders on the on-side, one of whom cuts it off. Two more though7.4Hannah Rowe to Alyssa Healy, FOUR, short of length, sits up for Healy and she duly whacks it through midwicket. Such is her power and timing, it storms past deep midwicket\\'s dive7.3Hannah Rowe to Alyssa Healy, FOUR, clears the front leg and clatters this over extra cover. This is brutal from Healy7.2Hannah Rowe to Beth Mooney, 1 run, full ball slanted in on middle and leg, whipped out to deep midwicket7.1Hannah Rowe to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, floaty full ball on off, pushes it through the coversHannah Rowe, right-arm medium, comes into the attack6.6Amelia Kerr to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, bit short with the googly, Healy rocks back and pulls to deep midwicket6.5Amelia Kerr to Beth Mooney, 1 run, loopy full toss, flicked down to long-on6.4Amelia Kerr to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, short outside off, slapped to sweeper cover6.3Amelia Kerr to Beth Mooney, 1 run, overpitched, smeared to long-off6.2Amelia Kerr to Beth Mooney, FOUR, mid-on is inside the ring, and this juicy full toss from Kerr is at the mercy of Mooney. She dances down and smokes it to the long-on boundary6.1Amelia Kerr to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, flat googly towards off, stabbed wide of coverAmelia Kerr [1.0-0-3-0] is back into the attack5.6Kasperek to Beth Mooney, FOUR, she\\'s got a nice piece of this.

Poor start to Kasperek\\'s spell, drifting it down leg, and Healy is severe with her swipe through backward squareLeigh Kasperek, right-arm off break, comes into the attack4.6Devine to Beth Mooney, FOUR, flicked over the infield by Mooney, who hasn\\'t looked at ease out there, but this should settle her down4.5Devine to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, full ball around off, smacked hard down the ground. There is a long-off in position to cut this off4.4Devine to Alyssa Healy, no run, they\\'re intent on keeping it really wide. This time, with Healy looking to swing leg-side, it works well for Devine as she gets it out of her arc, thereby inducing a thick toe-ender towards the keeper4.3Devine to Alyssa Healy, no run, width again, Healy has trouble reaching it this time and chops it off a thick under-edge behind the wickets4.2Devine to Alyssa Healy, FOUR, too much width being provided to Healy by New Zealand, and more often than not it\\'s getting punished. Short and wide, flays the cut over backward point4.1Devine to Alyssa Healy, no run, back of a length wide of off, flat-batted off the toe-end to extra cover3.6Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, short of length, Healy was advancing down looking to heave it away but can only drag it wide of midwicket for a single3.5Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, no run, almost yorker length on off, jammed to mid-on3.4Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, no run, patted into the covers3.3Tahuhu to Beth Mooney, 1 run, short of length on off, patted to cover-point and they set off for the single. Could\\'ve been hazardous with a clean pick-up, but there\\'s a misfield3.2Tahuhu to Beth Mooney, no run, back of a length on off, may have stopped in the pitch slightly. Mooney was looking to clip it through the on-side, proves unsuccessful3.1Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, short of length on off, cramps Healy and even gets big on her, before taking a thick outside edge past backward point2.6Devine to Beth Mooney, FOUR, full outside off, throws her bat at it and the outside edge flies to the right of third man. Desperate dive there, in vain2.5Devine to Beth Mooney, no run, full on off, driven to mid-off2.4Devine to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, oh dear, Kerr has dropped a simple chance at cover. Full ball outside off, it\\'s pretty wide and Healy can only get the toe-end of her bat onto it. It lobs up to the left of Kerr, quite a dolly really, and down it goes2.4Devine to Alyssa Healy, wide, pretty wide outside off, not the toughest call for the umpire2.3Devine to Beth Mooney, 1 run, back of a length on leg, swings it away to deep backward square2.2Devine to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, back of a length on middle, punches it to the left of mid-on2.1Devine to Alyssa Healy, FOUR, Healy off to a bit of a flier, relishing the opportunities to free her arms. Not that there was a great deal of width on this, but she stays leg-side of the ball and carves it through pointSophie Devine, right-arm medium, comes into the attack1.6Tahuhu to Beth Mooney, no run, short and wide, Mooney chases to cut but doesn\\'t connect1.5Tahuhu to Beth Mooney, no run, back of a length, zips through and strikes Mooney\\'s pad as she\\'s late on the clip. Had pitched outside leg1.4Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, yorker length outside off, squeezed away to third man1.3Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, FOUR, two balls for Healy so far, both cut shots, both crisp and this one races to the fence.

Poor delivery really1.2Tahuhu to Beth Mooney, 1 run, short of length outside off, Mooney finds the gap through a packed backward point region. Glides it to third man1.1Tahuhu to Beth Mooney, no run, short of length on off, blocked into the off-sideLea Tahuhu, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack0.6Amelia Kerr to Beth Mooney, 1 run, leading edge pops back over Kerr\\'s head, out of her reach. Mooney having lots of trouble with the googly, then has to take the trouble of diving for her crease at the non-striker\\'s end with mid-on attacking the ball0.5Amelia Kerr to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, short ball outside off, slapped to sweeper cover0.4Amelia Kerr to Beth Mooney, 1 run, nudges this through midwicket0.3Amelia Kerr to Beth Mooney, no run, deceived by the googly again, this time looking to work through the on-side and getting a thick leading edge0.2Amelia Kerr to Beth Mooney, no run, didn\\'t pick the googly, beaten by a long way! Pitched on off and turned away while Mooney was stuck on the crease, poking at it0.1Amelia Kerr to Beth Mooney, no run, short ball spinning down leg, Kerr\\'s lucky that Mooney has hit her pull straight to short fine leg. Few yards either side and it would\\'ve raced awayBeth Mooney and Alyssa Healy are at the crease. Beth Mooney is on strike. Amelia Kerr will open the attackThe national anthems are done.

Welcome to game 10 of ICC Women\\'s World T20 2018 between Australia Women and New Zealand Women.

Meanwhile, the loss to India in the first match has put White Ferns in a must-win situation and they will be desperate to get their campaign off and running today.

The action continues tomorrow as well. Do join us back. Until then, goodbye from us here.Meg Lanning, Australian captain: It\\'s a massive win for us. We were tested all the way. Really pleasing to get the win. We thought it was a par total. We felt if we could control the powerplay, we were in the game and I thought our bowlers did a fanstastic job. Taking the pace off the ball and trying to limit the boundaries, it was crucial to get the wickets at that stage. Healy has been dominating at the top with the bat and Haynes also chipped in towards the end.Amy Satterthwaite, New Zealand captain: Obviously disappointed with the loss. In all three facets of the game, we were outplayed. It was brilliant to see her (Suzie Bates) in form and she has been consistent for us over the years. But we needed someone to score runs at the other end. We didn\\'t execute our plans, there are glimpses of hope with the bat, just need them to step up at the right time.The Southern Stars book their spot in the Semi-Finals. Their 11th straight win in T20Is, on the contrary, 7th loss in a row for the White Ferns. On paper, it was a clash between the No. 1 and No. 2 ranked teams in the world but in the end, it was evident that there was a vast difference between the quality of these two teams. New Zealand were rattled early in their pursuit of 154, losing three wickets for 13. Bates and Martin launched a counter-attack with a 66-run partnership for the fourth wicket, keeping New Zealand in the hunt. But with Australian bowlers keeping things in check, pressure was mounting on the duo to up the ante. In search of big shots, both batswomen perished. New Zealand lost wickets in clusters from thereon and never really recovered. Presentations coming up.Alyssa Healy, Player of the Match: Just really pumped. The Kiwis were always going to come hard, they needed the win. Worked really hard on my batting, opened a new area of the ground that I can access if need be. Kiwis bowled really well in that middle period but 150 was always going to be tough to get. Might be a round of golf coming. Been a tough six weeks away from home. Looking forward to the game against India.17.3Sophie Molineux to Amelia Kerr, out Caught by Haynes!! Oh, what a catch. Sums up Australia\\'s fielding today, barring that blip from Kimmince, they have been outstanding in the field today. Molineux floated it well wide of off after seeing Kerr move across to the off-side. Went for the cut and hits it uppishly to the left of point where Haynes takes a sharp low catch. Australia win by 33 runs. Amelia Kerr c Haynes b Sophie Molineux 3(4)Sophie Molineux to Amelia Kerr, THAT\\'S OUT!! Caught!!17.2Sophie Molineux to Tahuhu, 1 run, wristed away to long-on17.1Sophie Molineux to Amelia Kerr, 1 run, Kerr shimmies out and tucks it behind squareSophie Molineux [3.0-0-18-1] is back into the attack16.6Schutt to Tahuhu, no run, full on off, Tahuhu blocks itLea Tahuhu, right handed bat, comes to the crease16.5Schutt to Hannah Rowe, out Bowled!! Gone! Southern Stars inching closer to victory. Leg-cutter that griped and straightened off the deck, Rowe advances and exposes all the stumps, ends up missing the cross-batted hoick. Hears the death rattle. Hannah Rowe b Schutt 4(8)Schutt to Hannah Rowe, THAT\\'S OUT!! Bowled!!16.4Schutt to Amelia Kerr, 1 run, helped towards backward square leg and it falls safe. Seemed like a top-edge as Kerr wanted to ramp it over the fielder at 4516.3Schutt to Hannah Rowe, 1 run, oh dear, Kimmince drops a dolly at mid-off. Flat-batted on the rise, Kimmince probably didn\\'t pick it and misjudged it. Grasses it onto the turf16.2Schutt to Amelia Kerr, 1 run, pitched up outside off, Kerr checks her defence to extra coverAmelia Kerr, right handed bat, comes to the crease16.1Schutt to Kasperek, out Caught by Haynes!! Last rites underway here. Schutt comes back and strikes in her new spell. Back of a length outside off, Kasperek charges out and scythes it straight to point. Haynes didn\\'t have to move an inch. Kasperek c Haynes b Schutt 12(7) [4s-2]Schutt to Kasperek, THAT\\'S OUT!! Caught!!Megan Schutt [2.0-0-9-1] is back into the attack15.6Delissa Kimmince to Kasperek, 1 run, direct-hit at the striker\\'s end and Kasperek was gone. Went for the cut and gets an outside edge to short third man. Was looking for a single and strolled half-way down the track before being sent back by Rowe. Kasperek turns and rushes in, but the throw misses the target. They eventually steal the run, courtesy overthrows15.5Delissa Kimmince to Hannah Rowe, 1 run, whipped off the pads to deep mid-wicket15.4Delissa Kimmince to Hannah Rowe, no run, leg-cutter, Rowe shuffles across and wears it on the pad15.3Delissa Kimmince to Kasperek, 1 run, sinks low and drags the slog-sweep to deep square leg15.2Delissa Kimmince to Hannah Rowe, 1 run, fuller length delivery outside off, driven to mid-off15.1Delissa Kimmince to Hannah Rowe, no run, cutter outside off, Rowe chases and can\\'t connect14.6Gardner to Kasperek, FOUR, oh, what a shot. Kasperek can bat, she certainly can. Engineers room by backing away to leg and opens up the off-side field by carving it over cover14.6Gardner to Kasperek, 3 wides, looped down leg, Kasperek misses the sweep and the ball clicks Healy\\'s pad before rolling away towards fine leg14.5Gardner to Kasperek, FOUR, edged and four. New Zealand want more of these. Fuller outside off, Kasperek throws her bat and a thick outside runs past short third man14.4Gardner to Hannah Rowe, 1 run, flicked away to long-on14.3Gardner to Hannah Rowe, no run, oh, almost had another one. Quicker and just outside off, Rowe pokes and missesHannah Rowe, right handed bat, comes to the crease14.2Gardner to Bates, out Lbw!! This should be the game. Bates departs and New Zealand\\'s hopes diminishes. Flat and skiddier, Bates came running down the track and ends up playing all over it. Gets rapped low on the pad, Healy went up straightaway, Gardner wasn\\'t too keen. But umpire Shaun George took his time before raising the finger. Good call as HawkEye shows that it was clipping the middle and leg stump. Bates lbw b Gardner 48(42) [4s-4 6s-1]Gardner to Bates, THAT\\'S OUT!! Lbw!!14.1Gardner to Kasperek, 1 run, bends low and brooms it away behind squareAshleigh Gardner [1.0-0-4-0] is back into the attack56 runs in 36 balls. White Ferns\\' will be banking on Bates\\' special here.13.6Delissa Kimmince to Kasperek, 1 run, dipping at the stumps, Kasperek clips it away to deep mid-wicket. \"Bowler, bowler\" was the shout and the throw came to the right end. The batswomen didn\\'t want to risk the second thereLeigh Kasperek, right handed bat, comes to the crease13.5Delissa Kimmince to Bezuidenhout, out Caught by Alyssa Healy!! Two wickets in a span of four balls and New Zealand are stuttering here. Short and rising outside off, Bezuidenhout was waiting to guide it to third man. Feathers a nick and Healy nestles in her glove. Australia on top. Bezuidenhout c Alyssa Healy b Delissa Kimmince 1(2)Delissa Kimmince to Bezuidenhout, THAT\\'S OUT!! Caught!!13.4Delissa Kimmince to Bates, 1 run, spectacular stop by Lanning at extra cover. Punched neatly from the crease and Australian captain dives across to stop it13.3Delissa Kimmince to Bezuidenhout, 1 run, veering on leg, tickled away to deep backward square leg13.2Delissa Kimmince to Bates, 1 run, swatted after lowering her stance to deep mid-wicketBernadine Bezuidenhout, right handed bat, comes to the crease13.1Delissa Kimmince to Maddy Green, out Caught by Perry!! Safe as houses is Perry. New Zealand lose half their side now. It was drifted on leg, Green was early into the pick-up shot. Gets a leading edge which balloons up to deep mid-wicket. Perry takes care of the rest. Maddy Green c Perry b Delissa Kimmince 8(7) [4s-1]Delissa Kimmince to Maddy Green, THAT\\'S OUT!! Caught!!13.1Delissa Kimmince to Maddy Green, wide, splayed down leg, Green tries to help it on its way but failsDelissa Kimmince [2.0-0-15-0] is back into the attack12.6Sophie Molineux to Maddy Green, 1 run, flighted delivery on middle, drilled away to long-on12.5Sophie Molineux to Maddy Green, no run, hurled quicker, Green gropes and misses12.4Sophie Molineux to Bates, 1 run, dances out, realises that she isn\\'t quite near the pitch. Adjusts and extends her defence to extra cover12.3Sophie Molineux to Maddy Green, 1 run, floated up, shaved away to long-on12.2Sophie Molineux to Bates, 1 run, straight-batted drive to long-on12.1Sophie Molineux to Maddy Green, 1 run, played down the pitch, awkward bounce for Molineux as the ball hits her wrists and ricochets away to the off-sideSophie Molineux [2.0-0-13-1] is back into the attack11.6Georgia Wareham to Bates, FOUR, another expensive over. Tossed up above the eyeline, Bates gets underneath it to smoke it over the bowler\\'s head11.5Georgia Wareham to Maddy Green, 1 run, pushed towards cover11.4Georgia Wareham to Maddy Green, FOUR, wow! What a way to get off the mark. Camps back and muscles it in the gap at deep mid-wicketMaddy Green, right handed bat, comes to the crease11.3Georgia Wareham to Katey Martin, out Stumped!! Wonderfully done. Wareham takes her revenge after getting hit for a boundary of the first ball. Well-flighted and lured Martin forward before dipping it late. Martin is yorked and lost her balance, dragging her back leg out of the crease. Healy calmly dislodges the bails quickly. Katey Martin st Alyssa Healy b Georgia Wareham 24(20) [4s-3]Georgia Wareham to Katey Martin, THAT\\'S OUT!! Stumped!!Has Healy pulled off a smart stumping here? She looks very convinced but the square leg umpire has sent the matter upstairs. Fair delivery. Oh, yes. Martin is gone.11.2Georgia Wareham to Katey Martin, no run, quicker and came in with the arm, Martin waits and taps it to point11.1Georgia Wareham to Katey Martin, FOUR, half-tracker and Martin takes toll.

Gets really low, waits for the ball to arrive and clubs it powerfully to the cow corner fenceDelissa Kimmince [1.0-0-7-0] is back into the attack9.6Perry to Bates, 1 run, length ball on off, pushes it into the off-side9.5Perry to Bates, 2 runs, advances down and carves it over extra cover, won\\'t have the legs to reach the boundary9.4Perry to Bates, FOUR, tipped over by the keeper. Should\\'ve been taken. Short of length, trumps Bates who had charged down looking to swing. Results in a top-edge that flies over the keeper. She got both hands on it9.3Perry to Katey Martin, 1 run, short of length outside off, dabs it to the left of short third man who has to put in the dive9.2Perry to Katey Martin, FOUR, full on off, little shimmy from Martin before swiping this over midwicket. Really good recovery from New Zealand with this partnership9.1Perry to Katey Martin, FOUR, short and wide, Martin smacks the cut hard through pointEllyse Perry [2.0-0-8-1] is back into the attack8.6Gardner to Bates, no run, fired full outside off, Bates mistimes the drive to cover8.5Gardner to Katey Martin, 1 run, darted through from back of a length, Martin tucks it through midwicket8.4Gardner to Bates, 1 run, swept to deep square leg8.3Gardner to Katey Martin, 1 run, turning in at the stumps, pivots on the back leg and works it behind square8.2Gardner to Bates, 1 run, almost yorks herself after dancing down, manages to jam it into the on-side8.1Gardner to Bates, no run, driven back down the pitch, hits the non-striker\\'s batAshleigh Gardner, right-arm off break, comes into the attack7.6Delissa Kimmince to Bates, 1 run, pushed to point, risky single, but the keeper broke the stumps before the throw arrived7.5Delissa Kimmince to Bates, 2 runs, magnificent in the field from Mooney. What desperation to stop the boundary. Bates\\'s slog-sweep looked set to beat her at long-on, but she threw herself across to cut it off7.4Delissa Kimmince to Katey Martin, 1 run, back of a length outside off, dabs it through point7.3Delissa Kimmince to Katey Martin, 2 runs, makes room and crashes it off the stumps through extra cover.

Brushes off her thigh and ricochets off the keeper\\'s gloves to short third man. Casual running from Bates, didn\\'t expect a throw at her end and a direct-hit would\\'ve got her6.5Georgia Wareham to Bates, 2 runs, short ball turning away outside off, Bates slaps it wide of sweeper cover6.4Georgia Wareham to Katey Martin, 1 run, flighted leg-break, swept to deep backward square6.3Georgia Wareham to Bates, 1 run, eases it down to long-on6.2Georgia Wareham to Bates, no run, Wareham pushes this flatter, skids through onto Bates\\'s pad as she\\'s beaten thoroughly on the pull6.1Georgia Wareham to Katey Martin, 1 run, flighted up at the stumps, driven to long-on6.1Georgia Wareham to Katey Martin, 3 wides, not a great start from Wareham, slipping well down the leg-side and beating her keeper tooGeorgia Wareham, right-arm medium, comes into the attack5.6Sophie Molineux to Katey Martin, 1 run, darted in with the arm, nudges it wide of midwicket5.5Sophie Molineux to Bates, 1 run, sliding in with the arm, chipped towards midwicket, falls slightly short5.4Sophie Molineux to Bates, no run, flat at the stumps, punched back5.3Sophie Molineux to Bates, no run, fired wide of off, spotting Bates\\'s charge.

Misses the reverse-paddle, struck in front of off. The pressure is getting to New Zealand Women, clouding their judgements. But Satterthwaite is unlucky here, as ball-tracking places the impact outside off. No review left. Satterthwaite lbw b Sophie Molineux 2(7)Sophie Molineux to Satterthwaite, THAT\\'S OUT!! Lbw!!2.4Sophie Molineux to Bates, 1 run, skids through from back of a length, Bates chops it through the covers2.3Sophie Molineux to Satterthwaite, 1 run, doesn\\'t quite get to the pitch after stepping out, drags a quick single to mid-on2.2Sophie Molineux to Satterthwaite, no run, length ball on off, played back down the pitch2.1Sophie Molineux to Satterthwaite, no run, pushed to cover-point2.1Sophie Molineux to Satterthwaite, 3 wides, down the leg-side, not a clean gather by the keeper which will add to the widesSophie Molineux, left-arm orthodox, comes into the attack1.6Perry to Satterthwaite, 1 run, squared up by a delivery leaving her with the angle, squirts it off a thick edge down to third man1.5Perry to Satterthwaite, no run, flat-footed in the crease, pats it into the off-side1.4Perry to Satterthwaite, no run, back of a length just outside off, chopped towards pointAmy Satterthwaite, left handed bat, comes to the crease1.3Perry to Devine, out Bowled!! Rams into middle stump after nipping through the gate. It\\'s a cracking start with the ball for Australia. This is a length delivery on off stump, Perry gets the ball to dart in of the seam which floors Devine whose footwork wasn\\'t the greatest. Devine b Perry 0(4)Perry to Devine, THAT\\'S OUT!! Bowled!!1.2Perry to Devine, no run, blunted into the off-side1.1Perry to Bates, 1 run, back of a length outside off, chops it down to third manEllyse Perry, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack0.6Schutt to Devine, no run, full ball on off, pushed to mid-off0.5Schutt to Devine, no run, back of a length outside off, stays low on Devine who tucks it to short midwicketSophie Devine, right handed bat, comes to the crease0.4Schutt to Anna Peterson, out Lbw!! Not a great shot this early in the innings. Short of length, Peterson looks to swipe it away cross-batted but it dips underneath and hits her on the thigh. She was quite low while playing the shot, so despite getting hit above the pad, the height won\\'t save her as she would\\'ve hoped while going for the review. This is crashing into middle and leg. New Zealand lose their review in the first over itself. Anna Peterson lbw b Schutt 0(2)Schutt to Anna Peterson, THAT\\'S OUT!! Lbw!!0.3Schutt to Anna Peterson, no run, short of length outside off, misses out on the cut0.2Schutt to Bates, 1 run, short of length just outside off, patted wide of point. Bates was running right down the centre of the pitch, before realizing that and stepping off quickly0.1Schutt to Bates, no run, length ball on off, defended towards cover-point0.1Schutt to Bates, 5 wides, big swing for Schutt, which takes the ball well down leg, beating the keeper\\'s dive as wellBates and Anna Peterson are at the crease. Bates is on strike. Schutt will open the attackWelcome back. Can New Zealand carry the momentum which they gained towards the end of their bowling effort?First 10 overs: 82 runs, 1 wicket. Last 10 overs: 71 runs, 6 wickets. Extraordinary comeback from the White Ferns in the second half. Alyssa Healy made most of her purple patch, recording a hat-trick of fifties. Mooney gave her good company and Australia were off to a good start. But once Healy fell, they lost their way as New Zealand bowlers chipped in with regular intervals, which put the breaks on the scoring rate. Rachael Haynes gave the required boost in the end to lift Australia over the 150-run mark. Leigh Kasperek was the pick of the bowlers for the White Ferns with three wickets. With the dew setting in, it\\'s advantage Kiwis going into the break. Stay tuned, we will be back shortly.19.6Devine to Sophie Molineux, out Caught by Amelia Kerr!! straight to point. So, a wicket off the final ball of the innings. Shortish outside off, Molineux went across and dinked it airly, fails to pick the gap and hits it to Kerr at backward point.

Cutter outside off, Haynes gets under it and smacks it in the air towards deep mid-wicket. Bates bends low and shells it19.2Devine to Haynes, 2 runs, steered using Devine\\'s pace square on the off-side. Picks up a couple of runs19.1Devine to Haynes, FOUR, short and outside off, Haynes gets back and across in her crease to swat it past square legSophie Devine [3.0-0-28-1] is back into the attack18.6Kasperek to Sophie Molineux, no run, skidding on with the arm, Molineux hangs deep to flay it to backward point18.5Kasperek to Haynes, 1 run, dropped. Haynes spanks it straight back at the bowler after coming down the track. Kasperek sits down and went with both hands. But it brushed the fingertips and zoomed away to long-off18.4Kasperek to Sophie Molineux, 1 run, Molineux ventures out and extends her arms into a drive to extra cover18.3Kasperek to Haynes, 1 run, quicker outside off, punched to coverSophie Molineux, left handed bat, comes to the crease18.2Kasperek to Perry, out Caught by Amelia Kerr!! Kerr resurrects her karm charts after dropping a sitter earlier. Third wicket for Kasperek, who has bowled beautifully today. Enticed Perry by tossing it up, Perry wanted to slog it across and lost her shape a bit. Fat top-edge is found and Kerr clasps onto it at point.

Bowls a length delivery well outside off. Haynes chases and gets an outside edge which runs away to the third man fence. The fielder was inside the ring, so it was easy-peasy..17.1Tahuhu to Haynes, FOUR, pulled away witheringly in the gap. Short at the torso, Haynes took it on the front foot and controlled the pull all along the ground, bisecting two fielders in the deep on the leg-sideLea Tahuhu [3.0-0-14-0] is back into the attack16.6Amelia Kerr to Perry, no run, tossed up outside off, Perry makes room after charging down the track and drives it to extra cover16.5Amelia Kerr to Haynes, 1 run, skips out and heaves it off the inner half to deep mid-wicket16.4Amelia Kerr to Perry, 1 run, Perry uses her feet aiming to go over extra cover, the ball spins in and takes the inner half to trickle towards mid-wicket16.3Amelia Kerr to Perry, no run, throat-clearing appeal for LBW, not given. White Ferns challenge the decision. Fair delivery. It was the googly from Kerr, Perry came forward to defend without reading the wrong \\'un. Only question is if it is hitting the stumps? Nope, missing leg. Good call from the on-field umpire there16.2Amelia Kerr to Haynes, 1 run, rushes out and hoicks it through the line towards long-on16.1Amelia Kerr to Haynes, FOUR, nice shot from Haynes. Flighted on middle, Haynes scooches low and sweeps it in the gap between deep square leg and deep mid-wicketAmelia Kerr [3.0-0-18-0] is back into the attackEllyse Perry, right handed bat, comes to the crease15.6Anna Peterson to Villani, out Lbw!! White Ferns are chipping away at the wickets. Tossed up outside off, spins in and raps Villani on the pad, who was preempting the sweep. Missed the line of the delivery and paid the price. Villani lbw b Anna Peterson 14(11) [4s-2]Anna Peterson to Villani, THAT\\'S OUT!! Lbw!!Villani is given out LBW, she consults with her partner and reviews. Over to third umpire. No issues with the front foot. No bat there, confirms UltraEdge. Pitching - outside off. Impact - umpire\\'s call. Wickets - hitting. Says HawkEye. OUT.15.6Anna Peterson to Villani, wide, slipping down leg, wided15.5Anna Peterson to Villani, no run, saw the batswoman come down the track, Peterson pulled her length back and cramped Villani for room. Inside-edges it to square leg15.4Anna Peterson to Haynes, 1 run, Haynes chips out and ends up getting an outside edge which dips in front of short third man. Wayward throw to the keeper\\'s end and they will take the single15.3Anna Peterson to Villani, 1 run, swept away behind square15.2Anna Peterson to Villani, FOUR, and again.. spotted the flighted delivery early, jumps down the track and lofts it elegantly over mid-off15.1Anna Peterson to Villani, FOUR, just over mid-off\\'s head. Villani creates her own room and hammers it beautifullyAnna Peterson, right-arm off break, comes into the attack14.6Kasperek to Haynes, no run, appeal for LBW, but only the keeper is excited. Slower and Haynes sits down to sweep. The ball rears up and pings the flap of the pad14.5Kasperek to Haynes, no run, chipped back uppishly, just short of the bowler14.4Kasperek to Haynes, 2 runs, Haynes takes a cue from her partner and directs it very fine with a paddle14.3Kasperek to Villani, 1 run, swept away it fine legRachael Haynes, left handed bat, comes to the crease14.2Kasperek to Gardner, out Caught by Bates!! My word, Bates almost shelled a sitter but shows tremendous presence of mind to hold onto it in the end. Gardner gambols out seeking for a biggie and hits it towards long-on. No power whatsoever behind the shot and straight to Bates, who went reverse-cupped. The ball bursts through her hands to hit her face, pops up in the air and Bates tries to take it on the rebound. Falls back, loses her balance and cushions it on her chest. After juggling twice, she manages to cling onto it in the third attempt. They went upstairs to check if it was clean catch as well. Gardner c Bates b Kasperek 10(13) [4s-1]Kasperek to Gardner, THAT\\'S OUT!!

In the end, they decide against taking the second13.4Bates to Gardner, 1 run, cutter outside off, slapped to extra cover. Good stop from the White Ferns\\' skipper13.4Bates to Gardner, wide, served closer to the tramlines, Bates is penalised13.3Bates to Villani, 1 run, tucked away through square leg13.2Bates to Gardner, 1 run, swings south but the ball goes in the north direction. Courtesy a thick outside edge; pitched up outside off, Gardner wanted to lift it down the ground, plays it a tad early and outside edge flies over point13.1Bates to Villani, 1 run, aims for the toe-crusher, Villani flicks it through square leg with a closed bat face13.1Bates to Villani, wide, lousy start for Bates. Veering down the leg-sideSuzie Bates, right-arm medium, comes into the attack12.6Hannah Rowe to Villani, 1 run, clipped off the pads to deep square leg12.5Hannah Rowe to Villani, no run, short of length on middle, Villani shows her straight batElyse Villani, right handed bat, comes to the crease12.4Hannah Rowe to Alyssa Healy, out Bowled!! Cleaned up. Healy perishes. Went a long way across her sticks and Rowe just attacked the stumps. Healy couldn\\'t get any bat and misses it. The ball strikes timber and Healy combusts after a well-made fifty. Alyssa Healy b Hannah Rowe 53(38) [4s-8]Hannah Rowe to Alyssa Healy, THAT\\'S OUT!! Bowled!!12.3Hannah Rowe to Gardner, 1 run, full-faced bat knock to long-on12.2Hannah Rowe to Gardner, no run, cracked off the meat, straight to extra cover12.2Hannah Rowe to Gardner, wide, and again. This was slung it miles down leg12.2Hannah Rowe to Gardner, wide, drifting down leg, Rowe has to reload12.1Hannah Rowe to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, in order to manufacture room to go inside-out over extra cover, Healy uses her bottom-hand to drill it down to long-on unable to find the placementHannah Rowe [1.0-0-16-0] is back into the attack11.6Amelia Kerr to Gardner, no run, slowish leg-break, outside off. Gardner waits back to quell it11.5Amelia Kerr to Gardner, no run, similar delivery, albeit no bounce on this googly. Gardner is clueless and gets slammed low on the pad11.4Amelia Kerr to Gardner, no run, sharp googly, Gardner doesn\\'t pick it and the ball spins in to rap the thigh pad11.3Amelia Kerr to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, \"Catch\" was the shout but it dies in front of long-on fielder. Healy after skipping out, miscued the loft. Gets it off the toe-end, hence no power behind it11.2Amelia Kerr to Gardner, 1 run, jumps back and across to punch it away to sweeper cover11.1Amelia Kerr to Gardner, FOUR, freebie and Gardner accepts it with glee. Loopu full toss at the stumps, Gardner takes it on the full to smole it through mid-wicket. Desperate effort from long-on fielder in vainAmelia Kerr [2.0-0-12-0] is back into the attack10.6Devine to Alyssa Healy, no run, Healy was slightly moving to leg which prevented her from reaching out to this fuller length delivery that was stalking the widelines outside off10.5Devine to Gardner, 1 run, full and straight, driven down the ground to long-on10.5Devine to Gardner, wide, tries a similar sort of trickery but Gardner doesn\\'t shuffle in her crease. Lets it passAshleigh Gardner, right handed bat, comes to the crease10.4Devine to Lanning, out Caught by Katey Martin!! Big wicket for the White Ferns. Devine outfoxes Lanning. Wafted full and wide of off after seeing Lanning move across her sticks. Australian skipper went with hard hands and feeds an outside edge that is easily pouched by Martin. Lanning c Katey Martin b Devine 5(6) [4s-1]Devine to Lanning, THAT\\'S OUT!! Caught!!10.3Devine to Lanning, no run, shortish outside off, Lanning goes deep and flays it to backward point10.3Devine to Lanning, 3 wides, swinging down the leg-side, awkward bounce for the keeper and it scraps the webbing before wandering away towards fine leg10.2Devine to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, full and wide of off, Healy squeezes it to extra cover10.1Devine to Lanning, 1 run, soft-handed dab to backward pointSophie Devine [2.0-0-21-0] is back into the attack9.6Tahuhu to Lanning, leg byes, 1 run, slanted in on leg, deflects off Lanning\\'s pad behind square9.5Tahuhu to Lanning, no run, back of a length outside off, went for a repeat of that previous shot but failed to connect this time9.4Tahuhu to Lanning, FOUR, oh, what timing! Merely a steer from Lanning, has raced away past backward point9.3Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, short of length outside off, Healy takes account of this slower ball and carefully dabs it wide of cover for a single which will bring up her fifty. Power-packed performance this9.2Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, no run, checks the shot to cover9.1Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, no run, short of length outside off, wanted to dab it to third man but was beaten on the edgeLea Tahuhu [2.0-0-9-0] is back into the attack8.6Kasperek to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, tossed up on middle, mistimes the sweep behind square8.5Kasperek to Alyssa Healy, FOUR, that wicket doesn\\'t seem to have much effect on Healy, who cames bustling down looking for an inside-out hit. She wasn\\'t quite to the pitch, resulting in an outside edge flying past the keeper8.4Kasperek to Alyssa Healy, no run, dabs it to backward pointMeg Lanning, right handed bat, comes to the crease8.3Kasperek to Beth Mooney, out Caught by Bates!! Looked like a deliberate chip shot from Mooney, pretty sure her idea was to get it over extra cover, but she ended up hitting a lot straighter. Bates, at long-off, runs forward and settles for a safe catch. Beth Mooney c Bates b Kasperek 26(24) [4s-4]Kasperek to Beth Mooney, THAT\\'S OUT!! Caught!!8.2Kasperek to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, another aggressive shot from Healy, although she got this off the toe-end.

She has decided it\\'s time to go. Charges at the medium pacer and tonks it over mid-off. Danger times for New Zealand7.5Hannah Rowe to Alyssa Healy, 2 runs, full at the pads, flicked in between two fielders on the on-side, one of whom cuts it off. Two more though7.4Hannah Rowe to Alyssa Healy, FOUR, short of length, sits up for Healy and she duly whacks it through midwicket. Such is her power and timing, it storms past deep midwicket\\'s dive7.3Hannah Rowe to Alyssa Healy, FOUR, clears the front leg and clatters this over extra cover. This is brutal from Healy7.2Hannah Rowe to Beth Mooney, 1 run, full ball slanted in on middle and leg, whipped out to deep midwicket7.1Hannah Rowe to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, floaty full ball on off, pushes it through the coversHannah Rowe, right-arm medium, comes into the attack6.6Amelia Kerr to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, bit short with the googly, Healy rocks back and pulls to deep midwicket6.5Amelia Kerr to Beth Mooney, 1 run, loopy full toss, flicked down to long-on6.4Amelia Kerr to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, short outside off, slapped to sweeper cover6.3Amelia Kerr to Beth Mooney, 1 run, overpitched, smeared to long-off6.2Amelia Kerr to Beth Mooney, FOUR, mid-on is inside the ring, and this juicy full toss from Kerr is at the mercy of Mooney. She dances down and smokes it to the long-on boundary6.1Amelia Kerr to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, flat googly towards off, stabbed wide of coverAmelia Kerr [1.0-0-3-0] is back into the attack5.6Kasperek to Beth Mooney, FOUR, she\\'s got a nice piece of this.

Poor start to Kasperek\\'s spell, drifting it down leg, and Healy is severe with her swipe through backward squareLeigh Kasperek, right-arm off break, comes into the attack4.6Devine to Beth Mooney, FOUR, flicked over the infield by Mooney, who hasn\\'t looked at ease out there, but this should settle her down4.5Devine to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, full ball around off, smacked hard down the ground. There is a long-off in position to cut this off4.4Devine to Alyssa Healy, no run, they\\'re intent on keeping it really wide. This time, with Healy looking to swing leg-side, it works well for Devine as she gets it out of her arc, thereby inducing a thick toe-ender towards the keeper4.3Devine to Alyssa Healy, no run, width again, Healy has trouble reaching it this time and chops it off a thick under-edge behind the wickets4.2Devine to Alyssa Healy, FOUR, too much width being provided to Healy by New Zealand, and more often than not it\\'s getting punished. Short and wide, flays the cut over backward point4.1Devine to Alyssa Healy, no run, back of a length wide of off, flat-batted off the toe-end to extra cover3.6Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, short of length, Healy was advancing down looking to heave it away but can only drag it wide of midwicket for a single3.5Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, no run, almost yorker length on off, jammed to mid-on3.4Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, no run, patted into the covers3.3Tahuhu to Beth Mooney, 1 run, short of length on off, patted to cover-point and they set off for the single. Could\\'ve been hazardous with a clean pick-up, but there\\'s a misfield3.2Tahuhu to Beth Mooney, no run, back of a length on off, may have stopped in the pitch slightly. Mooney was looking to clip it through the on-side, proves unsuccessful3.1Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, short of length on off, cramps Healy and even gets big on her, before taking a thick outside edge past backward point2.6Devine to Beth Mooney, FOUR, full outside off, throws her bat at it and the outside edge flies to the right of third man. Desperate dive there, in vain2.5Devine to Beth Mooney, no run, full on off, driven to mid-off2.4Devine to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, oh dear, Kerr has dropped a simple chance at cover. Full ball outside off, it\\'s pretty wide and Healy can only get the toe-end of her bat onto it. It lobs up to the left of Kerr, quite a dolly really, and down it goes2.4Devine to Alyssa Healy, wide, pretty wide outside off, not the toughest call for the umpire2.3Devine to Beth Mooney, 1 run, back of a length on leg, swings it away to deep backward square2.2Devine to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, back of a length on middle, punches it to the left of mid-on2.1Devine to Alyssa Healy, FOUR, Healy off to a bit of a flier, relishing the opportunities to free her arms. Not that there was a great deal of width on this, but she stays leg-side of the ball and carves it through pointSophie Devine, right-arm medium, comes into the attack1.6Tahuhu to Beth Mooney, no run, short and wide, Mooney chases to cut but doesn\\'t connect1.5Tahuhu to Beth Mooney, no run, back of a length, zips through and strikes Mooney\\'s pad as she\\'s late on the clip. Had pitched outside leg1.4Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, 1 run, yorker length outside off, squeezed away to third man1.3Tahuhu to Alyssa Healy, FOUR, two balls for Healy so far, both cut shots, both crisp and this one races to the fence.

Pitched on off and turned away while Mooney was stuck on the crease, poking at it0.1Amelia Kerr to Beth Mooney, no run, short ball spinning down leg, Kerr\\'s lucky that Mooney has hit her pull straight to short fine leg. Few yards either side and it would\\'ve raced awayBeth Mooney and Alyssa Healy are at the crease. Beth Mooney is on strike. Amelia Kerr will open the attackThe national anthems are done. Out walk the two opening batters while New Zealand Women disperse from their huddle. There\\'ve been two strong batting performances from the Australian Women so far.

We were happy to have a bowl. Under lights it starts to skid on a little bit more. Two changes today.Lanning, Australia Women captain: Going to have a bat tonight. Wicket seemed to have played well in the game earlier today. Going in with the same team.Australia Women have won the toss and have opted to batIt\\'s a battle between two antipodean nations. Welcome to game 10 of ICC Women\\'s World T20 2018 between Australia Women and New Zealand Women. The Southern Stars have had a great start to the tournament with two wins in two games and they are certainly living up to the favourites tag. Alyssa Healy has been in the form of her life and she remains a vital cog in Australia\\'s batting. Meanwhile, the loss to India in the first match has put White Ferns in a must-win situation and they will be desperate to get their campaign off and running today. Toss and teams in a short while.Teams:Australia Women (From): Alyssa Healy(w), Beth Mooney, Ellyse Perry, Meg Lanning(c), Ashleigh Gardner, Elyse Villani, Rachael Haynes, Sophie Molineux, Delissa Kimmince, Georgia Wareham, Megan Schutt, Nicole Bolton, Tayla Vlaeminck, Nicola CareyNew Zealand Women (From): Suzie Bates, Anna Peterson, Sophie Devine, Jess Watkin, Amy Satterthwaite(c), Katey Martin(w), Maddy Green, Leigh Kasperek, Hayley Jensen, Amelia Kerr, Lea Tahuhu, Bernadine Bezuidenhout, KE Ebrahim, Holly Huddleston, Hannah Rowe  LATEST NEWS   Blow to the neck brought back memories of Phillip Hughes for Steve Smith4h ago    Haynes to captain Sydney Thunder in upcoming WBBL season5h ago  Feroz Shah Kotla stadium to be renamed after Arun Jaitley7h ago  Keemo Paul replaces Miguel Cummins for Jamaica Test9h ago  Uthappa to lead Kerala in shorter formats10h ago  More News    .cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;} .cb-list-heading{font-weight:normal!important} ,  Australia Women vs New Zealand Women, 10th Match, Group B - Live Cricket Score, Commentary   Series:  ICC Womens World T20 2018 Venue: Providence Stadium,Guyana Date &amp; Time: Nov 13,\\xa008:00 PM\\xa0LOCAL    Commentary Scorecard Highlights  Full Commentary Live Blog Points Table Match Facts News Photos ,  Series:  ICC Womens World T20 2018 Venue: Providence Stadium,Guyana Date &amp; Time: Nov 13,\\xa008:00 PM\\xa0LOCAL  ,     AUSW 153/7 (20) NZW 120/10 (17.3)    Australia Women won by 33 runs  PLAYER OF THE MATCH Alyssa Healy   BatsmanRB4s6sSRBowlerOMRWECO&nbsp;*Have Your SayPLAYER OF THE MATCHPLAYER OF THE SERIES.cb-min-vid{background: #000; color:#fff; padding:5px; height:54px; overflow: hidden; margin:0px -10px 0 0;}That\\'s it from today. The action continues tomorrow as well. Do join us back. Until then, goodbye from us here.Meg Lanning, Australian captain: It\\'s a massive win for us. We were tested all the way. Really pleasing to get the win. We thought it was a par total. We felt if we could control the powerplay, we were in the game and I thought our bowlers did a fanstastic job. Taking the pace off the ball and trying to limit the boundaries, it was crucial to get the wickets at that stage. Healy has been dominating at the top with the bat and Haynes also chipped in towards the end.Amy Satterthwaite, New Zealand captain: Obviously disappointed with the loss. In all three facets of the game, we were outplayed. It was brilliant to see her (Suzie Bates) in form and she has been consistent for us over the years. But we needed someone to score runs at the other end. We didn\\'t execute our plans, there are glimpses of hope with the bat, just need them to step up at the right time.The Southern Stars book their spot in the Semi-Finals. Their 11th straight win in T20Is, on the contrary, 7th loss in a row for the White Ferns. On paper, it was a clash between the No. 1 and No. 2 ranked teams in the world but in the end, it was evident that there was a vast difference between the quality of these two teams. New Zealand were rattled early in their pursuit of 154, losing three wickets for 13. Bates and Martin launched a counter-attack with a 66-run partnership for the fourth wicket, keeping New Zealand in the hunt. But with Australian bowlers keeping things in check, pressure was mounting on the duo to up the ante. In search of big shots, both batswomen perished. New Zealand lost wickets in clusters from thereon and never really recovered. Presentations coming up.Alyssa Healy, Player of the Match: Just really pumped. The Kiwis were always going to come hard, they needed the win. Worked really hard on my batting, opened a new area of the ground that I can access if need be. Kiwis bowled really well in that middle period but 150 was always going to be tough to get. Might be a round of golf coming. Been a tough six weeks away from home. Looking forward to the game against India.17.3Sophie Molineux to Amelia Kerr, out Caught by Haynes!! Oh, what a catch. Sums up Australia\\'s fielding today, barring that blip from Kimmince, they have been outstanding in the field today. Molineux floated it well wide of off after seeing Kerr move across to the off-side. Went for the cut and hits it uppishly to the left of point where Haynes takes a sharp low catch. Australia win by 33 runs. Amelia Kerr c Haynes b Sophie Molineux 3(4)Sophie Molineux to Amelia Kerr, THAT\\'S OUT!!

Gone! Southern Stars inching closer to victory. Leg-cutter that griped and straightened off the deck, Rowe advances and exposes all the stumps, ends up missing the cross-batted hoick. Hears the death rattle. Hannah Rowe b Schutt 4(8)Schutt to Hannah Rowe, THAT\\'S OUT!! Bowled!!16.4Schutt to Amelia Kerr, 1 run, helped towards backward square leg and it falls safe. Seemed like a top-edge as Kerr wanted to ramp it over the fielder at 4516.3Schutt to Hannah Rowe, 1 run, oh dear, Kimmince drops a dolly at mid-off. Flat-batted on the rise, Kimmince probably didn\\'t pick it and misjudged it. Grasses it onto the turf16.2Schutt to Amelia Kerr, 1 run, pitched up outside off, Kerr checks her defence to extra coverAmelia Kerr, right handed bat, comes to the crease16.1Schutt to Kasperek, out Caught by Haynes!! Last rites underway here. Schutt comes back and strikes in her new spell. Back of a length outside off, Kasperek charges out and scythes it straight to point. Haynes didn\\'t have to move an inch.

Caught!!Megan Schutt [2.0-0-9-1] is back into the attack15.6Delissa Kimmince to Kasperek, 1 run, direct-hit at the striker\\'s end and Kasperek was gone. Went for the cut and gets an outside edge to short third man. Was looking for a single and strolled half-way down the track before being sent back by Rowe. Kasperek turns and rushes in, but the throw misses the target. They eventually steal the run, courtesy overthrows15.5Delissa Kimmince to Hannah Rowe, 1 run, whipped off the pads to deep mid-wicket15.4Delissa Kimmince to Hannah Rowe, no run, leg-cutter, Rowe shuffles across and wears it on the pad15.3Delissa Kimmince to Kasperek, 1 run, sinks low and drags the slog-sweep to deep square leg15.2Delissa Kimmince to Hannah Rowe, 1 run, fuller length delivery outside off, driven to mid-off15.1Delissa Kimmince to Hannah Rowe, no run, cutter outside off, Rowe chases and can\\'t connect14.6Gardner to Kasperek, FOUR, oh, what a shot. Kasperek can bat, she certainly can.

New Zealand want more of these. Fuller outside off, Kasperek throws her bat and a thick outside runs past short third man14.4Gardner to Hannah Rowe, 1 run, flicked away to long-on14.3Gardner to Hannah Rowe, no run, oh, almost had another one. Quicker and just outside off, Rowe pokes and missesHannah Rowe, right handed bat, comes to the crease14.2Gardner to Bates, out Lbw!! This should be the game. Bates departs and New Zealand\\'s hopes diminishes. Flat and skiddier, Bates came running down the track and ends up playing all over it. Gets rapped low on the pad, Healy went up straightaway, Gardner wasn\\'t too keen. But umpire Shaun George took his time before raising the finger. Good call as HawkEye shows that it was clipping the middle and leg stump. Bates lbw b Gardner 48(42) [4s-4 6s-1]Gardner to Bates, THAT\\'S OUT!!

The batswomen didn\\'t want to risk the second thereLeigh Kasperek, right handed bat, comes to the crease13.5Delissa Kimmince to Bezuidenhout, out Caught by Alyssa Healy!! Two wickets in a span of four balls and New Zealand are stuttering here. Short and rising outside off, Bezuidenhout was waiting to guide it to third man.

Safe as houses is Perry. New Zealand lose half their side now. It was drifted on leg, Green was early into the pick-up shot. Gets a leading edge which balloons up to deep mid-wicket. Perry takes care of the rest. Maddy Green c Perry b Delissa Kimmince 8(7) [4s-1]Delissa Kimmince to Maddy Green, THAT\\'S OUT!!

Tossed up above the eyeline, Bates gets underneath it to smoke it over the bowler\\'s head11.5Georgia Wareham to Maddy Green, 1 run, pushed towards cover11.4Georgia Wareham to Maddy Green, FOUR, wow! What a way to get off the mark. Camps back and muscles it in the gap at deep mid-wicketMaddy Green, right handed bat, comes to the crease11.3Georgia Wareham to Katey Martin, out Stumped!! Wonderfully done. Wareham takes her revenge after getting hit for a boundary of the first ball. Well-flighted and lured Martin forward before dipping it late. Martin is yorked and lost her balance, dragging her back leg out of the crease. Healy calmly dislodges the bails quickly. Katey Martin st Alyssa Healy b Georgia Wareham 24(20) [4s-3]Georgia Wareham to Katey Martin, THAT\\'S OUT!! Stumped!!Has Healy pulled off a smart stumping here? She looks very convinced but the square leg umpire has sent the matter upstairs. Fair delivery. Oh, yes.

Should\\'ve been taken. Short of length, trumps Bates who had charged down looking to swing. Results in a top-edge that flies over the keeper. She got both hands on it9.3Perry to Katey Martin, 1 run, short of length outside off, dabs it to the left of short third man who has to put in the dive9.2Perry to Katey Martin, FOUR, full on off, little shimmy from Martin before swiping this over midwicket.

Misses the reverse-paddle, struck in front of off. The pressure is getting to New Zealand Women, clouding their judgements. But Satterthwaite is unlucky here, as ball-tracking places the impact outside off. No review left. Satterthwaite lbw b Sophie Molineux 2(7)Sophie Molineux to Satterthwaite, THAT\\'S OUT!!

Rams into middle stump after nipping through the gate. It\\'s a cracking start with the ball for Australia. This is a length delivery on off stump, Perry gets the ball to dart in of the seam which floors Devine whose footwork wasn\\'t the greatest. Devine b Perry 0(4)Perry to Devine, THAT\\'S OUT!! Bowled!!1.2Perry to Devine, no run, blunted into the off-side1.1Perry to Bates, 1 run, back of a length outside off, chops it down to third manEllyse Perry, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack0.6Schutt to Devine, no run, full ball on off, pushed to mid-off0.5Schutt to Devine, no run, back of a length outside off, stays low on Devine who tucks it to short midwicketSophie Devine, right handed bat, comes to the crease0.4Schutt to Anna Peterson, out Lbw!! Not a great shot this early in the innings. Short of length, Peterson looks to swipe it away cross-batted but it dips underneath and hits her on the thigh. She was quite low while playing the shot, so despite getting hit above the pad, the height won\\'t save her as she would\\'ve hoped while going for the review. This is crashing into middle and leg. New Zealand lose their review in the first over itself. Anna Peterson lbw b Schutt 0(2)Schutt to Anna Peterson, THAT\\'S OUT!!

Bates is on strike. Schutt will open the attackWelcome back. Can New Zealand carry the momentum which they gained towards the end of their bowling effort?First 10 overs: 82 runs, 1 wicket. Last 10 overs: 71 runs, 6 wickets. Extraordinary comeback from the White Ferns in the second half. Alyssa Healy made most of her purple patch, recording a hat-trick of fifties. Mooney gave her good company and Australia were off to a good start. But once Healy fell, they lost their way as New Zealand bowlers chipped in with regular intervals, which put the breaks on the scoring rate. Rachael Haynes gave the required boost in the end to lift Australia over the 150-run mark. Leigh Kasperek was the pick of the bowlers for the White Ferns with three wickets. With the dew setting in, it\\'s advantage Kiwis going into the break. Stay tuned, we will be back shortly.19.6Devine to Sophie Molineux, out Caught by Amelia Kerr!! straight to point. So, a wicket off the final ball of the innings. Shortish outside off, Molineux went across and dinked it airly, fails to pick the gap and hits it to Kerr at backward point.

Haynes spanks it straight back at the bowler after coming down the track. Kasperek sits down and went with both hands. But it brushed the fingertips and zoomed away to long-off18.4Kasperek to Sophie Molineux, 1 run, Molineux ventures out and extends her arms into a drive to extra cover18.3Kasperek to Haynes, 1 run, quicker outside off, punched to coverSophie Molineux, left handed bat, comes to the crease18.2Kasperek to Perry, out Caught by Amelia Kerr!! Kerr resurrects her karm charts after dropping a sitter earlier. Third wicket for Kasperek, who has bowled beautifully today. Enticed Perry by tossing it up, Perry wanted to slog it across and lost her shape a bit. Fat top-edge is found and Kerr clasps onto it at point.

Bowls a length delivery well outside off. Haynes chases and gets an outside edge which runs away to the third man fence. The fielder was inside the ring, so it was easy-peasy..17.1Tahuhu to Haynes, FOUR, pulled away witheringly in the gap. Short at the torso, Haynes took it on the front foot and controlled the pull all along the ground, bisecting two fielders in the deep on the leg-sideLea Tahuhu [3.0-0-14-0] is back into the attack16.6Amelia Kerr to Perry, no run, tossed up outside off, Perry makes room after charging down the track and drives it to extra cover16.5Amelia Kerr to Haynes, 1 run, skips out and heaves it off the inner half to deep mid-wicket16.4Amelia Kerr to Perry, 1 run, Perry uses her feet aiming to go over extra cover, the ball spins in and takes the inner half to trickle towards mid-wicket16.3Amelia Kerr to Perry, no run, throat-clearing appeal for LBW, not given. White Ferns challenge the decision. Fair delivery. It was the googly from Kerr, Perry came forward to defend without reading the wrong \\'un. Only question is if it is hitting the stumps? Nope, missing leg. Good call from the on-field umpire there16.2Amelia Kerr to Haynes, 1 run, rushes out and hoicks it through the line towards long-on16.1Amelia Kerr to Haynes, FOUR, nice shot from Haynes. Flighted on middle, Haynes scooches low and sweeps it in the gap between deep square leg and deep mid-wicketAmelia Kerr [3.0-0-18-0] is back into the attackEllyse Perry, right handed bat, comes to the crease15.6Anna Peterson to Villani, out Lbw!! White Ferns are chipping away at the wickets. Tossed up outside off, spins in and raps Villani on the pad, who was preempting the sweep. Missed the line of the delivery and paid the price. Villani lbw b Anna Peterson 14(11) [4s-2]Anna Peterson to Villani, THAT\\'S OUT!! Lbw!!Villani is given out LBW, she consults with her partner and reviews. Over to third umpire.

Inside-edges it to square leg15.4Anna Peterson to Haynes, 1 run, Haynes chips out and ends up getting an outside edge which dips in front of short third man. Wayward throw to the keeper\\'s end and they will take the single15.3Anna Peterson to Villani, 1 run, swept away behind square15.2Anna Peterson to Villani, FOUR, and again.. spotted the flighted delivery early, jumps down the track and lofts it elegantly over mid-off15.1Anna Peterson to Villani, FOUR, just over mid-off\\'s head.

Slower and Haynes sits down to sweep. The ball rears up and pings the flap of the pad14.5Kasperek to Haynes, no run, chipped back uppishly, just short of the bowler14.4Kasperek to Haynes, 2 runs, Haynes takes a cue from her partner and directs it very fine with a paddle14.3Kasperek to Villani, 1 run, swept away it fine legRachael Haynes, left handed bat, comes to the crease14.2Kasperek to Gardner, out Caught by Bates!! My word, Bates almost shelled a sitter but shows tremendous presence of mind to hold onto it in the end. Gardner gambols out seeking for a biggie and hits it towards long-on. No power whatsoever behind the shot and straight to Bates, who went reverse-cupped. The ball bursts through her hands to hit her face, pops up in the air and Bates tries to take it on the rebound. Falls back, loses her balance and cushions it on her chest. After juggling twice, she manages to cling onto it in the third attempt. They went upstairs to check if it was clean catch as well.

Courtesy a thick outside edge; pitched up outside off, Gardner wanted to lift it down the ground, plays it a tad early and outside edge flies over point13.1Bates to Villani, 1 run, aims for the toe-crusher, Villani flicks it through square leg with a closed bat face13.1Bates to Villani, wide, lousy start for Bates.

Gets it off the toe-end, hence no power behind it11.2Amelia Kerr to Gardner, 1 run, jumps back and across to punch it away to sweeper cover11.1Amelia Kerr to Gardner, FOUR, freebie and Gardner accepts it with glee. Loopu full toss at the stumps, Gardner takes it on the full to smole it through mid-wicket. Desperate effort from long-on fielder in vainAmelia Kerr [2.0-0-12-0] is back into the attack10.6Devine to Alyssa Healy, no run, Healy was slightly moving to leg which prevented her from reaching out to this fuller length delivery that was stalking the widelines outside off10.5Devine to Gardner, 1 run, full and straight, driven down the ground to long-on10.5Devine to Gardner, wide, tries a similar sort of trickery but Gardner doesn\\'t shuffle in her crease.

There is a long-off in position to cut this off4.4Devine to Alyssa Healy, no run, they\\'re intent on keeping it really wide.

Wicket seemed to have played well in the game earlier today. Going in with the same team.Australia Women have won the toss and have opted to batIt\\'s a battle between two antipodean nations. Welcome to game 10 of ICC Women\\'s World T20 2018 between Australia Women and New Zealand Women. The Southern Stars have had a great start to the tournament with two wins in two games and they are certainly living up to the favourites tag. Alyssa Healy has been in the form of her life and she remains a vital cog in Australia\\'s batting. Meanwhile, the loss to India in the first match has put White Ferns in a must-win situation and they will be desperate to get their campaign off and running today. Toss and teams in a short while.Teams:Australia Women (From): Alyssa Healy(w), Beth Mooney, Ellyse Perry, Meg Lanning(c), Ashleigh Gardner, Elyse Villani, Rachael Haynes, Sophie Molineux, Delissa

#000; color:#fff; padding:5px; height:54px; overflow: hidden; margin:0px -10px 0 0;}That\\'s it from today. The action continues tomorrow as well. Do join us back. Until then, goodbye from us here.Meg Lanning, Australian captain: It\\'s a massive win for us. We were tested all the way. Really pleasing to get the win. We thought it was a par total. We felt if we could control the powerplay, we were in the game and I thought our bowlers did a fanstastic job. Taking the pace off the ball and trying to limit the boundaries, it was crucial to get the wickets at that stage. Healy has been dominating at the top with the bat and Haynes also chipped in towards the end.Amy Satterthwaite, New Zealand captain: Obviously disappointed with the loss. In all three facets of the game, we were outplayed. It was brilliant to see her (Suzie Bates) in form and she has been consistent for us over the years. But we needed someone to score runs at the other end. We didn\\'t execute our plans, there are glimpses of hope with the bat, just need them to step up at the right time.The Southern Stars book their spot in the Semi-Finals. Their 11th straight win in T20Is, on the contrary, 7th loss in a row for the White Ferns. On paper, it was a clash between the No. 1 and No. 2 ranked teams in the world but in the end, it was evident that there was a vast difference between the quality of these two teams. New Zealand were rattled early in their pursuit of 154, losing three wickets for 13. Bates and Martin launched a counter-attack with a 66-run partnership for the fourth wicket, keeping New Zealand in the hunt. But with Australian bowlers keeping things in check, pressure was mounting on the duo to up the ante. In search of big shots, both batswomen perished. New Zealand lost wickets in clusters from thereon and never really recovered. Presentations coming up.Alyssa Healy, Player of the Match: Just really pumped. The Kiwis were always going to come hard, they needed the win. Worked really hard on my batting, opened a new area of the ground that I can access if need be. Kiwis bowled really well in that middle period but 150 was always going to be tough to get. Might be a round of golf coming. Been a tough six weeks away from home. Looking forward to the game against India.17.3Sophie Molineux to Amelia Kerr, out Caught by Haynes!! Oh, what a catch. Sums up Australia\\'s fielding today, barring that blip from Kimmince, they have been outstanding in the field today. Molineux floated it well wide of off after seeing Kerr move across to the off-side. Went for the cut and hits it uppishly to the left of point where Haynes takes a sharp low catch. Australia win by 33 runs. Amelia Kerr c Haynes b Sophie Molineux 3(4)Sophie Molineux to Amelia Kerr, THAT\\'S OUT!! Caught!!17.2Sophie Molineux to Tahuhu, 1 run, wristed away to long-on17.1Sophie Molineux to Amelia Kerr, 1 run, Kerr shimmies out and tucks it behind squareSophie Molineux [3.0-0-18-1] is back into the attack16.6Schutt to Tahuhu, no run, full on off, Tahuhu blocks itLea Tahuhu, right handed bat, comes to the crease16.5Schutt to Hannah Rowe, out Bowled!! Gone! Southern Stars inching closer to victory. Leg-cutter that griped and straightened off the deck, Rowe advances and exposes all the stumps, ends up missing the cross-batted hoick. Hears the death rattle. Hannah Rowe b Schutt 4(8)Schutt to Hannah Rowe, THAT\\'S OUT!! Bowled!!16.4Schutt to Amelia Kerr, 1 run, helped towards backward square leg and it falls safe. Seemed like a top-edge as Kerr wanted to ramp it over the fielder at 4516.3Schutt to Hannah Rowe, 1 run, oh dear, Kimmince drops a dolly at mid-off. Flat-batted on the rise, Kimmince probably didn\\'t pick it and misjudged it. Grasses it onto the turf16.2Schutt to Amelia Kerr, 1 run, pitched up outside off, Kerr checks her defence to extra coverAmelia Kerr, right handed bat, comes to the crease16.1Schutt to Kasperek, out Caught by Haynes!! Last rites underway here. Schutt comes back and strikes in her new spell. Back of a length outside off, Kasperek charges out and scythes it straight to point. Haynes didn\\'t have to move an inch. Kasperek c Haynes b Schutt 12(7) [4s-2]Schutt to Kasperek, THAT\\'S OUT!! Caught!!Megan Schutt [2.0-0-9-1] is back into the attack15.6Delissa Kimmince to Kasperek, 1 run, direct-hit at the striker\\'s end and Kasperek was gone. Went for the cut and gets an outside edge to short third man. Was looking for a single and strolled half-way down the track before being sent back by Rowe. Kasperek turns and rushes in, but the throw misses the target. They eventually steal the run, courtesy overthrows15.5Delissa Kimmince to Hannah Rowe, 1 run, whipped off the pads to deep mid-wicket15.4Delissa Kimmince to Hannah Rowe, no run, leg-cutter, Rowe shuffles across and wears it on the pad15.3Delissa Kimmince to Kasperek, 1 run, sinks low and drags the slog-sweep to deep square leg15.2Delissa Kimmince to Hannah Rowe, 1 run, fuller length delivery outside off, driven to mid-off15.1Delissa Kimmince to Hannah Rowe, no run, cutter outside off, Rowe chases and can\\'t connect14.6Gardner to Kasperek, FOUR, oh, what a shot. Kasperek can bat, she certainly can. Engineers room by backing away to leg and opens up the off-side field by carving it over cover14.6Gardner to Kasperek, 3 wides, looped down leg, Kasperek misses the sweep and the ball clicks Healy\\'s pad before rolling away towards fine leg14.5Gardner to Kasperek, FOUR, edged and four. New Zealand want more of these. Fuller outside off, Kasperek throws her bat and a thick outside runs past short third man14.4Gardner to Hannah Rowe, 1 run, flicked away to long-on14.3Gardner to Hannah Rowe, no run, oh, almost had another one. Quicker and just outside off, Rowe pokes and missesHannah Rowe, right handed bat, comes to the crease14.2Gardner to Bates, out Lbw!! This should be the game. Bates departs and New Zealand\\'s hopes diminishes. Flat and skiddier, Bates came running down the track and ends up playing all over it. Gets rapped low on the pad, Healy went up straightaway, Gardner wasn\\'t too keen. But umpire Shaun George took his time before raising the finger. Good call as HawkEye shows that it was clipping the middle and leg stump. Bates lbw b Gardner 48(42) [4s-4 6s-1]Gardner to Bates, THAT\\'S OUT!! Lbw!!14.1Gardner to Kasperek, 1 run, bends low and brooms it away behind squareAshleigh Gardner [1.0-0-4-0] is back into the attack56 runs in 36 balls. White Ferns\\' will be banking on Bates\\' special here.13.6Delissa Kimmince to Kasperek, 1 run, dipping at the stumps, Kasperek clips it away to deep mid-wicket. \"Bowler, bowler\" was the shout and the throw came to the right end. The batswomen didn\\'t want to risk the second thereLeigh Kasperek, right handed bat, comes to the crease13.5Delissa Kimmince to Bezuidenhout, out Caught by Alyssa Healy!! Two wickets in a span of four balls and New Zealand are stuttering here. Short and rising outside off, Bezuidenhout was waiting to guide it to third man. Feathers a nick and Healy nestles in her glove. Australia on top. Bezuidenhout c Alyssa Healy b Delissa Kimmince 1(2)Delissa Kimmince to Bezuidenhout, THAT\\'S OUT!! Caught!!13.4Delissa Kimmince to Bates, 1 run, spectacular stop by Lanning at extra cover. Punched neatly from the crease and Australian captain dives across to stop it13.3Delissa Kimmince to Bezuidenhout, 1 run, veering on leg, tickled away to deep backward square leg13.2Delissa Kimmince to Bates, 1 run, swatted after lowering her stance to deep mid-wicketBernadine Bezuidenhout, right handed bat, comes to the crease13.1Delissa Kimmince to Maddy Green, out Caught by Perry!! Safe as houses is Perry. New Zealand lose half their side now. It was drifted on leg, Green was early into the pick-up shot. Gets a leading edge which balloons up to deep mid-wicket. Perry takes care of the rest. Maddy Green c Perry b Delissa Kimmince 8(7) [4s-1]Delissa Kimmince to Maddy Green, THAT\\'S OUT!! Caught!!13.1Delissa Kimmince to Maddy Green, wide, splayed down leg, Green tries to help it on its way but failsDelissa Kimmince [2.0-0-15-0] is back into the attack12.6Sophie Molineux to Maddy Green, 1 run, flighted delivery on middle, drilled away to long-on12.5Sophie Molineux to Maddy Green, no run, hurled quicker, Green gropes and misses12.4Sophie Molineux to Bates, 1 run, dances out, realises that she isn\\'t quite near the pitch. Adjusts and extends her defence to extra cover12.3Sophie Molineux to Maddy Green, 1 run, floated up, shaved away to long-on12.2Sophie Molineux to Bates, 1 run, straight-batted drive to long-on12.1Sophie Molineux to Maddy Green, 1 run, played down the pitch, awkward bounce for Molineux as the ball hits her wrists and ricochets away to the off-sideSophie Molineux [2.0-0-13-1] is back into the attack11.6Georgia Wareham to Bates, FOUR, another expensive over. Tossed up above the eyeline, Bates gets underneath it to smoke it over the bowler\\'s head11.5Georgia Wareham to Maddy Green, 1 run, pushed towards cover11.4Georgia Wareham to Maddy Green, FOUR, wow! What a way to get off the mark. Camps back and muscles it in the gap at deep mid-wicketMaddy Green, right handed bat, comes to the crease11.3Georgia Wareham to Katey Martin, out Stumped!! Wonderfully done. Wareham takes her revenge after getting hit for a boundary of the first ball. Well-flighted and lured Martin forward before dipping it late. Martin is yorked and lost her balance, dragging her back leg out of the crease. Healy calmly dislodges the bails quickly. Katey Martin st Alyssa Healy b Georgia Wareham 24(20) [4s-3]Georgia Wareham to Katey Martin, THAT\\'S OUT!! Stumped!!Has Healy pulled off a smart stumping here? She looks very convinced but the square leg umpire has sent the matter upstairs. Fair delivery. Oh, yes.

Should\\'ve been taken. Short of length, trumps Bates who had charged down looking to swing. Results in a top-edge that flies over the keeper. She got both hands on it9.3Perry to Katey Martin, 1 run, short of length outside off, dabs it to the left of short third man who has to put in the dive9.2Perry to Katey Martin, FOUR, full on off, little shimmy from Martin before swiping this over midwicket.

Misses the reverse-paddle, struck in front of off. The pressure is getting to New Zealand Women, clouding their judgements. But Satterthwaite is unlucky here, as ball-tracking places the impact outside off. No review left. Satterthwaite lbw b Sophie Molineux 2(7)Sophie Molineux to Satterthwaite, THAT\\'S OUT!!

Rams into middle stump after nipping through the gate. It\\'s a cracking start with the ball for Australia. This is a length delivery on off stump, Perry gets the ball to dart in of the seam which floors Devine whose footwork wasn\\'t the greatest. Devine b Perry 0(4)Perry to Devine, THAT\\'S OUT!! Bowled!!1.2Perry to Devine, no run, blunted into the off-side1.1Perry to Bates, 1 run, back of a length outside off, chops it down to third manEllyse Perry, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack0.6Schutt to Devine, no run, full ball on off, pushed to mid-off0.5Schutt to Devine, no run, back of a length outside off, stays low on Devine who tucks it to short midwicketSophie Devine, right handed bat, comes to the crease0.4Schutt to Anna Peterson, out Lbw!! Not a great shot this early in the innings. Short of length, Peterson looks to swipe it away cross-batted but it dips underneath and hits her on the thigh. She was quite low while playing the shot, so despite getting hit above the pad, the height won\\'t save her as she would\\'ve hoped while going for the review. This is crashing into middle and leg. New Zealand lose their review in the first over itself. Anna Peterson lbw b Schutt 0(2)Schutt to Anna Peterson, THAT\\'S OUT!!

Bates is on strike. Schutt will open the attackWelcome back. Can New Zealand carry the momentum which they gained towards the end of their bowling effort?First 10 overs: 82 runs, 1 wicket. Last 10 overs: 71 runs, 6 wickets. Extraordinary comeback from the White Ferns in the second half. Alyssa Healy made most of her purple patch, recording a hat-trick of fifties. Mooney gave her good company and Australia were off to a good start. But once Healy fell, they lost their way as New Zealand bowlers chipped in with regular intervals, which put the breaks on the scoring rate. Rachael Haynes gave the required boost in the end to lift Australia over the 150-run mark. Leigh Kasperek was the pick of the bowlers for the White Ferns with three wickets. With the dew setting in, it\\'s advantage Kiwis going into the break. Stay tuned, we will be back shortly.19.6Devine to Sophie Molineux, out Caught by Amelia Kerr!! straight to point. So, a wicket off the final ball of the innings. Shortish outside off, Molineux went across and dinked it airly, fails to pick the gap and hits it to Kerr at backward point.

Haynes spanks it straight back at the bowler after coming down the track. Kasperek sits down and went with both hands. But it brushed the fingertips and zoomed away to long-off18.4Kasperek to Sophie Molineux, 1 run, Molineux ventures out and extends her arms into a drive to extra cover18.3Kasperek to Haynes, 1 run, quicker outside off, punched to coverSophie Molineux, left handed bat, comes to the crease18.2Kasperek to Perry, out Caught by Amelia Kerr!! Kerr resurrects her karm charts after dropping a sitter earlier. Third wicket for Kasperek, who has bowled beautifully today. Enticed Perry by tossing it up, Perry wanted to slog it across and lost her shape a bit. Fat top-edge is found and Kerr clasps onto it at point.

Bowls a length delivery well outside off. Haynes chases and gets an outside edge which runs away to the third man fence. The fielder was inside the ring, so it was easy-peasy..17.1Tahuhu to Haynes, FOUR, pulled away witheringly in the gap. Short at the torso, Haynes took it on the front foot and controlled the pull all along the ground, bisecting two fielders in the deep on the leg-sideLea Tahuhu [3.0-0-14-0] is back into the attack16.6Amelia Kerr to Perry, no run, tossed up outside off, Perry makes room after charging down the track and drives it to extra cover16.5Amelia Kerr to Haynes, 1 run, skips out and heaves it off the inner half to deep mid-wicket16.4Amelia Kerr to Perry, 1 run, Perry uses her feet aiming to go over extra cover, the ball spins in and takes the inner half to trickle towards mid-wicket16.3Amelia Kerr to Perry, no run, throat-clearing appeal for LBW, not given. White Ferns challenge the decision. Fair delivery. It was the googly from Kerr, Perry came forward to defend without reading the wrong \\'un. Only question is if it is hitting the stumps? Nope, missing leg. Good call from the on-field umpire there16.2Amelia Kerr to Haynes, 1 run, rushes out and hoicks it through the line towards long-on16.1Amelia Kerr to Haynes, FOUR, nice shot from Haynes. Flighted on middle, Haynes scooches low and sweeps it in the gap between deep square leg and deep mid-wicketAmelia Kerr [3.0-0-18-0] is back into the attackEllyse Perry, right handed bat, comes to the crease15.6Anna Peterson to Villani, out Lbw!! White Ferns are chipping away at the wickets. Tossed up outside off, spins in and raps Villani on the pad, who was preempting the sweep. Missed the line of the delivery and paid the price. Villani lbw b Anna Peterson 14(11) [4s-2]Anna Peterson to Villani, THAT\\'S OUT!! Lbw!!Villani is given out LBW, she consults with her partner and reviews. Over to third umpire.

Inside-edges it to square leg15.4Anna Peterson to Haynes, 1 run, Haynes chips out and ends up getting an outside edge which dips in front of short third man. Wayward throw to the keeper\\'s end and they will take the single15.3Anna Peterson to Villani, 1 run, swept away behind square15.2Anna Peterson to Villani, FOUR, and again.. spotted the flighted delivery early, jumps down the track and lofts it elegantly over mid-off15.1Anna Peterson to Villani, FOUR, just over mid-off\\'s head.

Slower and Haynes sits down to sweep. The ball rears up and pings the flap of the pad14.5Kasperek to Haynes, no run, chipped back uppishly, just short of the bowler14.4Kasperek to Haynes, 2 runs, Haynes takes a cue from her partner and directs it very fine with a paddle14.3Kasperek to Villani, 1 run, swept away it fine legRachael Haynes, left handed bat, comes to the crease14.2Kasperek to Gardner, out Caught by Bates!! My word, Bates almost shelled a sitter but shows tremendous presence of mind to hold onto it in the end. Gardner gambols out seeking for a biggie and hits it towards long-on. No power whatsoever behind the shot and straight to Bates, who went reverse-cupped. The ball bursts through her hands to hit her face, pops up in the air and Bates tries to take it on the rebound. Falls back, loses her balance and cushions it on her chest. After juggling twice, she manages to cling onto it in the third attempt. They went upstairs to check if it was clean catch as well.

Courtesy a thick outside edge; pitched up outside off, Gardner wanted to lift it down the ground, plays it a tad early and outside edge flies over point13.1Bates to Villani, 1 run, aims for the toe-crusher, Villani flicks it through square leg with a closed bat face13.1Bates to Villani, wide, lousy start for Bates.

Gets it off the toe-end, hence no power behind it11.2Amelia Kerr to Gardner, 1 run, jumps back and across to punch it away to sweeper cover11.1Amelia Kerr to Gardner, FOUR, freebie and Gardner accepts it with glee. Loopu full toss at the stumps, Gardner takes it on the full to smole it through mid-wicket. Desperate effort from long-on fielder in vainAmelia Kerr [2.0-0-12-0] is back into the attack10.6Devine to Alyssa Healy, no run, Healy was slightly moving to leg which prevented her from reaching out to this fuller length delivery that was stalking the widelines outside off10.5Devine to Gardner, 1 run, full and straight, driven down the ground to long-on10.5Devine to Gardner, wide, tries a similar sort of trickery but Gardner doesn\\'t shuffle in her crease.

There is a long-off in position to cut this off4.4Devine to Alyssa Healy, no run, they\\'re intent on keeping it really wide.

Welcome to game 10 of ICC Women\\'s World T20 2018 between Australia Women and New Zealand Women.

Meanwhile, the loss to India in the first match has put White Ferns in a must-win situation and they will be desperate to get their campaign off and running today.
